## Source Selection Methodology

### Multi-Perspective Requirement
For each major event, research must include:
- ✅ Western sources (US, UK, European media)
- ✅ Non-Western sources (Chinese, Russian, Middle Eastern, Indian, African)
- ✅ Region-specific sources (local media for local events)
- ✅ Official sources (government/system operators)

### Quantitative Claim Verification
All quantitative claims verified with:
- **Minimum**: One Tier 1 source OR two Tier 2 sources
- **Preferred**: Multiple Tier 1 sources with cross-regional corroboration

### Conflicting Data Resolution
When sources conflict:
1. Note the discrepancy explicitly
2. Assess credibility tier
3. Consider source motivation (state media vs independent)
4. Use range or note uncertainty

**Example**: China's gold purchases - official PBOC (44t) vs Goldman Sachs estimate (570t). Both reported with explicit discrepancy noted.

### Bias Recognition
All sources have perspective. Research acknowledges:
- State media (Global Times, Interfax) = official government position
- Financial press (Bloomberg, FT) = Western financial center viewpoint
- Regional media (Arab News, SCMP) = regional business perspective
- Crypto industry (Decrypt) = pro-crypto bias

**Mitigation**: Use diverse sources across perspectives.
