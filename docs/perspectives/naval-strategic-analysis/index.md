### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Strategic maritime chokepoints persist for millennia despite technological changes. Bosphorus: 17-mile strait, 'most strategically important maritime passage in history,' Constantinople called 'center of the world.' Controlled by Byzantines (330-1453), Ottomans (1453-1922), now NATO ally Turkey. Strait of Hormuz: 20% of world's oil (20.7M barrels/day in 2018), continuous unrest since 1980s, Iran repeatedly threatens closure. Malacca: 50,000+ vessels yearly, 'most vulnerable chokepoint,' shortest route Japan/Korea/China to Middle East oil. Suez Canal: revolutionized trade in 1860s, 4.5M barrels/day, 7.5% of world trade (2011), closed 8 years post-1967 war. Gibraltar: strategic since ancient times, importance increased post-Suez. Geography unchanged; control contested continuously.

**Key Points**:
- Bosphorus: 'most strategically important passage in history' - Byzantine/Ottoman/NATO
- Hormuz: 20% world oil, continuous Iran tension 1980s-present
- Malacca: 50,000 vessels/year, 'most vulnerable' but unavoidable for Asia
- Suez: revolutionized trade 1860s, closed 8 years post-1967, 7.5% world trade
- Gibraltar: strategic ancient→modern, importance increased with Suez Canal
