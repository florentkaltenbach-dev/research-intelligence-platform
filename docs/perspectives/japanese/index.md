### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Japan exemplifies extreme geographic vulnerability: island nation importing 97% of energy (83% fossil fuels), 90% crude oil from Middle East. 94% of crude from six Middle East countries. Two-thirds of imports transit South China Sea after Malacca Strait. Maritime chokepoints = existential vulnerability: 2025 saw 80 piracy incidents in Malacca straits (first 6 months) vs 21 in same period 2024. Additional risks: accidents, contested South China Sea territorial disputes (China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam), potential Chinese blockade in conflict. Geography immutable: as island nation, heavily dependent on energy/food imports; maritime security essential to peace/prosperity. 2025: US-Japanese experts convened 3 times discussing security dynamics of clean energy transition, acknowledging renewable energy as national security imperative to reduce geographic vulnerability.

**Key Points**:
- Island nation: 97% energy imports, 90% crude oil from Middle East
- Two-thirds of imports via contested South China Sea after Malacca transit
- 2025: piracy incidents quadrupled in Malacca (80 vs 21 incidents)
- Existential vulnerability to chokepoint closure in China conflict scenario
- Clean energy transition recognized as national security imperative 2025
