## Perspectives by Event

### [US Sovereign Wealth Fund: State Capitalism Emerges in Market Economy](/events/us-sovereign-wealth-fund-state-capitalism-emerges-in-market-economy)

Europe recognizes own version of state capitalism (Airbus model) vindicated. US shift reduces pressure on European industrial policy. Sees US-China convergence on state role while Europe maintains hybrid model. Concerned about being squeezed between US and Chinese state champions. Intel case shows US now competitor for European semiconductor ambitions (ASML dependence remains). MP Materials investment threatens European rare earth strategies. Views US approach as improvised vs Europe's institutional frameworks (EIB, national development banks). Questions US sustainability - political cycles may reverse policy. Europe's patient capital model may prove more durable.

**Key Points**:
- European state capitalism (Airbus) vindicated
- US shift reduces pressure on EU industrial policy
- US-China convergence, Europe maintains hybrid
- Squeezed between US-China state champions
- US improvised vs EU institutional frameworks
- Questions US sustainability across political cycles

### [AI Infrastructure Arms Race: $325 Billion Big Tech Investment in 2025](/events/ai-infrastructure-arms-race-325-billion-big-tech-investment-in-2025)

EU deeply concerned about falling behind in AI race - only 4.8% global high-end compute, $50B investment vs US $470B. Recognizes strategic vulnerability in both AI and semiconductors. Debate between supporting European champions vs partnering with US/Asian firms. Regulatory approach (AI Act) seen domestically as necessary but criticized internationally as handicapping EU competitiveness. ASML (Netherlands) controls extreme UV lithography, giving EU leverage in semiconductor supply chain. Struggles with fragmentation - no EU-wide tech champion comparable to US Big Tech. Growing recognition that digital sovereignty requires massive state investment.

**Key Points**:
- EU only 4.8% AI compute, $50B vs US $470B
- Strategic vulnerability recognized
- Regulatory approach may handicap competitiveness
- ASML gives leverage in semiconductor chain
- Fragmentation prevents EU champions
- Digital sovereignty requires state investment
