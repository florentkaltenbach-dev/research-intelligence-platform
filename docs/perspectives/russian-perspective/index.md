## Perspectives by Event

### [NATO 5% GDP Defense Spending: $2.9 Trillion by 2035 Rearmament](/events/nato-5-gdp-defense-spending-29-trillion-by-2035-rearmament)

Views NATO expansion and rearmament as proof of Western hostility. Frames 5% spending as preparation for eventual confrontation with Russia. Argues NATO outspends Russia already ($1.506T vs Russia's lower spending), making claims of defensive nature implausible. Sees Ukraine as proxy war and NATO expansion as existential threat. Notes Europe's economic struggles make 5% unsustainable long-term. Emphasizes Russia's asymmetric advantages: nuclear arsenal, resource self-sufficiency, tested defense industry. Views NATO cohesion as fragile - US-Europe tensions, Turkey's independence, Hungary's resistance show cracks.

**Key Points**:
- NATO expansion + rearmament proves Western hostility
- 5% preparing for confrontation with Russia
- Already massive spending gap: NATO $1.5T vs Russia
- Ukraine = proxy war, expansion = threat
- Europe's 5% economically unsustainable
- Russia has asymmetric advantages: nuclear, resources, industry

- Represents 34-35% of Russia total reserves
- Accumulated 40M oz between 2014-2020 (post-Crimea)

### [India's Strategic Autonomy: Multi-Alignment Between Quad, Russia, and China](/events/indias-strategic-autonomy-multi-alignment-between-quad-russia-and-china)

Russia views India as critical partner for evading Western sanctions. India-Russia trade reached $66B, largely settled in local currencies. Energy exports to India offset Western market losses. Defense relationship remains strong despite India diversifying suppliers (36% from Russia vs 55% previously). Concerned about India's Quad participation and growing US ties, but pragmatic about India's multi-alignment. Sees India as proof that non-Western powers can resist US pressure. Views India-Russia-China triangle as ideal but accepts India-China tensions limit full alignment.

**Key Points**:
- India critical for sanctions evasion, $66B trade
- Energy exports to India offset Western losses
- Defense relationship strong but declining share
- Accepts India's multi-alignment pragmatically
- India proves non-Western can resist US pressure
- Ideal: Russia-India-China triangle, reality: complications
