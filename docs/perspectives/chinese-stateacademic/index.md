### [El Salvador Bitcoin Experiment Reversal: IMF-Mandated Rollback](/events/el-salvador-bitcoin-experiment-reversal-imf-mandated-rollback)

Limited coverage but frames as validation of China CBDC (digital yuan) approach: state-controlled, centralized digital currency vs decentralized cryptocurrency. Chinese analysis presents El Salvador case as proof that unregulated crypto cannot serve monetary policy functions. Reinforces China position that digital currencies must be sovereign-issued and controlled.

**Key Points**:
- Validates state-controlled CBDC approach
- Demonstrates unregulated crypto unsuitability for monetary policy
- China digital yuan model vindicated
- Decentralized crypto lacks institutional backing
- Sovereign control essential for currency function

### [Central Bank Gold Accumulation: 1,000+ Tonnes Annually for Three Consecutive Years](/events/central-bank-gold-accumulation-1000-tonnes-annually-for-three-consecutive-years)

PBOC officially added 44 tonnes in 2024, resuming purchases in November 2024. However, Goldman Sachs estimates actual purchases ~40t/month, with one analysis claiming 570t covertly purchased in 2024. Chinese academic sources frame as reserve diversification consistent with yuan internationalization strategy, viewing Western reporting with suspicion. Gold represents only ~5% of China reserves vs 15% global average, suggesting room for expansion.

**Key Points**:
- Official: 44t added in 2024, total 2,298.53t by Q2 2025
- Alternative estimates: 570t purchased covertly in 2024
- Goldman Sachs estimates ~40t/month actual purchases
- Gold only 5% of reserves vs 15% global average
- Consistent with yuan internationalization strategy
