## Perspectives by Event

### [BRICS Payment Systems & De-Dollarization: 90% Intra-BRICS Local Currency Trade](/events/brics-payment-systems-de-dollarization-90-intra-brics-local-currency-trade)

MOST AMBIVALENT NARRATIVE and directly contradicts BRICS unity framing. Foreign Minister Jaishankar (December 2024): India has never been for de-dollarization and no proposal for BRICS currency. India pursuing bilateral rupee internationalization via RBI SRVA (Special Rupee Vostro Account) expansion instead of multilateral BRICS system. Views unified system as potential Chinese dominance; prefers Indian-controlled alternatives. US is India largest trade partner with no interest in weakening dollar.

**Key Points**:
- Jaishankar: India has never been for de-dollarization
- No proposal for BRICS currency - explicit rejection
- RBI SRVA expansion for bilateral rupee settlements
- US is India largest trade partner
- Fears Chinese dominance in unified BRICS system
