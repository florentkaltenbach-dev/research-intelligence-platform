## Perspectives by Event

### [Dollar Weaponization Accelerates Global De-dollarization Trends](/events/dollar-weaponization-accelerates-global-de-dollarization-trends)

Experts assess de-dollarization as real long-term trend but not imminent collapse. Dollar share slipped from peak but still dominant at ~58% of reserves (Q1 2025). Key insight: current push more widespread than past efforts, suggesting structural shift rather than temporary fluctuation. However, no currency offers viable alternative: euro constrained by EU fragmentation, yuan not fully convertible, no other currency has scale. Likely outcome: slow, gradual decline toward multipolar reserve currency system rather than sudden displacement. Factors accelerating trend: US weaponization, debt concerns, Trump's erratic policy. Factors supporting dollar: network effects, institutional depth, no alternative with comparable liquidity/stability.

**Key Points**: ["Real long-term trend but not imminent collapse", "~58% reserves Q1 2025 - still dominant but declining from peak", "More widespread than past efforts, suggesting structural shift", "No viable alternative: euro limited, yuan restricted, others lack scale", "Likely: slow multipolar evolution, not sudden displacement"]
