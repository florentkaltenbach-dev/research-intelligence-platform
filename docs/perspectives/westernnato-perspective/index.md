## Perspectives by Event

### [NATO 5% GDP Defense Spending: $2.9 Trillion by 2035 Rearmament](/events/nato-5-gdp-defense-spending-29-trillion-by-2035-rearmament)

Framed as necessary response to Russian aggression and Chinese assertiveness. 5% target driven by Trump administration pressure and European recognition that US security guarantee not permanent. Ukraine war proves Europe must defend itself. European leaders emphasize sacrifice necessary - defense vs healthcare/welfare trade-offs explicit. Baltic states, Poland see existential threat from Russia. Western Europe slower to embrace but gradually accepting necessity. Sees decade-long rearmament as reversing post-Cold War 'peace dividend' cuts. Industrial base atrophied during peacetime, must rebuild.

**Key Points**:
- Response to Russian threat and Chinese rise
- Trump pressure + European self-defense recognition
- Ukraine proves Europe must defend itself
- Defense vs welfare explicit trade-offs
- Reversing post-Cold War peace dividend
- Industrial base rebuild necessary
