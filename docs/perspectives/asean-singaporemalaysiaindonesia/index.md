### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Malacca Strait: 82,000 vessels annually, 40% of global trade, 80% of China's crude oil imports, 25% of world's seaborne trade. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia as littoral states enjoy economic benefits while caught between great powers. Trilateral naval patrols + information sharing significantly curbed piracy since mid-2000s. ASEAN adopted neutral stance amid great-power competition, minimizing retaliation likelihood that could hurt regional maritime trade. Hedging strategy: fostering ties with both US and China while reaching out to EU as 'third party.' Geographic position forces pragmatic balancing: cannot afford to pick sides. US/Allies assure safe passage; China depends on strait for 90% of trade; both want control. ASEAN leverages geographic position for economic benefit while avoiding military alignment. Proof geography matters but doesn't determine singular outcome - regional actors have agency.

**Key Points**:
- Malacca: 82,000 vessels/year, 40% global trade, 80% China oil imports
- Littoral states: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia - trilateral patrols curbed piracy
- Neutral stance: avoid retaliation, maintain trade benefits from both sides
- Hedging strategy: ties with US + China, reaching to EU as third party
- Geographic position enables agency: benefit economically, avoid military alignment
