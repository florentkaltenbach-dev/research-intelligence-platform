## Perspectives by Event

### [Supply Chain Regionalization: $2.3 Trillion Semiconductor Fragmentation](/events/supply-chain-regionalization-23-trillion-semiconductor-fragmentation)

China views Western friend-shoring as attempted containment doomed to fail. Emphasizes China's integrated advantages: Complete supply chain, rare earth dominance (gallium, germanium controls July 2023; rare earths Oct 2025), massive domestic market. Argues friend-shoring will increase costs without eliminating China dependence - too embedded in global supply chains. Notes Western companies still investing in China despite rhetoric. 'Silicon sovereignty' push: China increasing self-sufficiency in semiconductors, though lagging in advanced nodes. Sees US-led fragmentation as opportunity: Forces China to innovate domestically, reduces Western leverage. Long-term: Expects China and Global South to form larger bloc than Western allies.

**Key Points**:
- Friend-shoring = attempted containment, will fail
- China advantages: Complete chain, rare earth dominance, huge market
- Fragmentation increases costs without eliminating dependence
- Silicon sovereignty: Self-sufficiency in semiconductors
- Forces domestic innovation, reduces Western leverage
- China + Global South bloc larger than West

### [NATO 5% GDP Defense Spending: $2.9 Trillion by 2035 Rearmament](/events/nato-5-gdp-defense-spending-29-trillion-by-2035-rearmament)

China notes NATO's Indo-Pacific focus beyond traditional Atlantic area. Sees 5% spending as part of broader US strategy to contain China. Questions NATO's defensive claims given expansion into Asia-Pacific through Japan, South Korea, Australia partnerships. Views massive defense spending as sign of Western economic militarization and declining competitiveness. Argues China's lower defense spending as percentage of GDP (estimated 1.5-2%) shows peaceful intentions. Frames NATO rearmament as diverting resources from economic competition where China excels. Expects European fiscal limits to constrain actual spending.

**Key Points**:
- NATO expanding to Indo-Pacific = China containment
- 5% spending shows Western militarization
- Questions 'defensive' claims given Asia-Pacific expansion
- China 1.5-2% GDP shows peaceful intentions
- Diverts resources from economic competition
- European fiscal reality will constrain spending

### [US Sovereign Wealth Fund: State Capitalism Emerges in Market Economy](/events/us-sovereign-wealth-fund-state-capitalism-emerges-in-market-economy)

Frames as vindication of China's state-led development model. US adopting Chinese approach after decades of criticizing it proves state capitalism superiority. Sees hypocrisy in US maintaining 'free market' rhetoric while implementing dirigisme. Views Intel stake as admission that market failed to compete with Chinese industrial policy. Notes US starting from weaker position - China's state capacity more developed. Expects US political system to constrain effectiveness compared to China's coordinated approach. Sees opportunity: While US debates, China executes. Long-term: Validates multipolar model where each system competes on results, not ideology.

**Key Points**:
- Vindication of China state-led model
- US adopting Chinese approach after criticizing it
- Proves state capitalism superiority
- Intel stake = market failed vs Chinese policy
- US state capacity weaker, politics constrain
- China executes while US debates

### [AI Infrastructure Arms Race: $325 Billion Big Tech Investment in 2025](/events/ai-infrastructure-arms-race-325-billion-big-tech-investment-in-2025)

DeepSeek (Jan 2025) presented as proof China can do more with less - efficiency over brute force. Framed as validation of alternative approach to AI development. China controls 14% high-end compute but argues constraints force innovation. Views US export controls as failing - China advancing despite restrictions. Semiconductor investment focuses on self-sufficiency and catching up in key nodes. Sees AI race as marathon, not sprint. Notes US spending may be inefficient and unsustainable. Long-term: China expects to close gap through indigenous innovation and state coordination.

**Key Points**:
- DeepSeek proves efficiency over brute force approach
- Constraints forcing Chinese innovation
- US export controls failing to prevent advances
- Self-sufficiency focus in semiconductors
- AI race is marathon, US lead not permanent
- State coordination advantage over market chaos

### [Africa in Multipolar Order: 30% Critical Minerals & US-China Competition](/events/africa-in-multipolar-order-30-critical-minerals-us-china-competition)

Frames Africa engagement as South-South cooperation and anti-colonial solidarity, contrasting with Western 'neo-imperialism.' China's $4.5B lithium investments and infrastructure projects presented as win-win development. No political conditionality seen as respecting sovereignty vs Western imposing values. BRI in Africa: Roads, rails, ports, energy projects addressing infrastructure gap Western countries failed to fill. BRICS expansion including Egypt, Ethiopia strengthens Global South bloc. Long-term: Africa's young population (1.3B now, 2.5B by 2050) represents future consumer market and geopolitical weight. China positioning early for African century.

**Key Points**:
- South-South cooperation vs Western neo-imperialism
- $4.5B lithium + infrastructure = win-win development
- No political conditions respects sovereignty
- BRI fills infrastructure gap West neglected
- BRICS expansion (Egypt, Ethiopia) strengthens Global South
- Africa's young population = future market and power

Concerned about India's Quad participation as containment effort. Views India's strategic autonomy as preventing full US alignment, which benefits China. Recognizes India as emerging competitor for Global South leadership. Long-term: China expects India to be major power center in multipolar world, prefers managed competition to confrontation.

**Key Points**:
- $140B trade despite border tensions
- Oct 2024 agreement shows preference for functional relations
- Quad concerns but India autonomy prevents full US alignment
- Competition for Global South leadership
- Long-term: India emerging power center
