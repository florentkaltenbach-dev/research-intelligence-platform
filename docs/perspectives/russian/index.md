## Perspectives by Event

### [BRICS 17th Summit: Expansion and Payment System Development](/events/brics-17th-summit-expansion-and-payment-system-development)

Russia pushes BRICS as mechanism for evading Western sanctions and reducing dollar dependence. Foreign Minister Lavrov announced BRICS Pay pilot 'before end of 2026,' later revised by Deputy FM Ryabkov to operational status by 2030. Promotes bilateral currency settlements: 95% of Russia-China trade ($244.8B in 2024) now in rubles/yuan. Nearly 90% of all Russia-China transactions in local currencies. Thirty Russian banks connected to Cross-Border Interbank Payment System by May 2025. Views BRICS as strategic alternative to Western-dominated financial architecture.

**Key Points**:
- BRICS Pay operational target: 2030 (revised from 2026 pilot)
- 95% of Russia-China trade in rubles/yuan, avoiding sanctions
- Alternative to SWIFT essential for strategic autonomy
- 30 Russian banks connected to China's CIPS by May 2025
- China essential partner for Russia; Russia less critical for China (asymmetric)

### [Dollar Weaponization Accelerates Global De-dollarization Trends](/events/dollar-weaponization-accelerates-global-de-dollarization-trends)

Russia leads de-dollarization push after $300B asset freeze in February 2022 demonstrated dollar vulnerability. 90% of Russia-China trade ($244.8B in 2024) now in rubles/yuan. Nearly 90% of all Russia-China transactions in local currencies. 30 Russian banks connected to China's CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System) by May 2025. However, 98% of Chinese banks rejected direct yuan payments from Russia due to secondary sanctions concerns - exposing vulnerability to US financial pressure. Russia views de-dollarization as essential strategic autonomy measure, but progress limited by Western financial system's network effects and China's caution.

**Key Points**:
- $300B asset freeze (Feb 2022) proved dollar is weaponized
- 90% Russia-China trade in rubles/yuan ($244.8B in 2024)
- 30 Russian banks on China's CIPS by May 2025
- Vulnerability: 98% Chinese banks reject Russia yuan payments (sanctions fear)
- De-dollarization essential for strategic autonomy despite challenges

### [European Strategic Autonomy: Trump's Return Forces Defense Reckoning](/events/european-strategic-autonomy-trumps-return-forces-defense-reckoning)

Russia views European strategic autonomy with interest: wedge between US and Europe serves Russian interests. However, European rearmament concerning: Russia's military budget >6% GDP by 2025, armed forces expanding to 1.5M personnel. If Europe successfully builds autonomous defense capability independent of US, could be more threatening than divided NATO relying on unreliable Trump. Russian calculation: European political will questionable - better to face Europe dependent on US under Trump than autonomous militarized Europe. Currently, European internal divisions and slow decision-making benefit Russia. Ukraine conflict demonstrates European dependence on US military support. Russia betting Europe lacks unity for true strategic autonomy.

**Key Points**:
- US-Europe wedge serves Russian interests short-term
- Russia military budget >6% GDP, forces expanding to 1.5M
- Autonomous militarized Europe potentially more threatening than divided NATO
- European divisions and slow decisions currently benefit Russia
- Betting Europe lacks unity for true strategic autonomy

### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Russia's strategy validates Mackinder's Heartland Theory: 'Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the world.' Russia's Ukraine actions (2014 Crimea, 2022 full invasion) driven by Heartland considerations: securing strategic transit routes and establishing buffer against NATO in Eastern Europe is classic Heartland policy of defending 'pivot area.' Heartland provides natural defensive bulwark due to vast expanse plus economic leverage via oil, gas, mineral wealth. Russia views geography as destiny: vast territory provides strategic depth historically defeating Napoleon, Hitler. Central Asia competition critical: Russia formerly dominant, now challenged by China in 'New Great Game.' Geography unchanged for centuries; Russia's strategic imperatives constant despite regime changes (Tsarist→Soviet→Putin).

**Key Points**:
- Ukraine 2014/2022: classic Heartland policy securing Eastern Europe buffer vs NATO
- Heartland provides strategic depth (defeated Napoleon, Hitler) plus resource wealth
- Central Asia: formerly Russian-dominated, now China emerging as 'big winner'
- Geographic imperatives constant across regime changes: Tsarist→Soviet→Putin
- Natural defensive advantage from vast expanse, but infrastructure challenges persist
