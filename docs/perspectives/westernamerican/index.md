### [BRICS 17th Summit: Expansion and Payment System Development](/events/brics-17th-summit-expansion-and-payment-system-development)

Trump administration views BRICS de-dollarization as direct threat to US financial hegemony and 'exorbitant privilege.' Renewed threats of 100% tariffs on BRICS nations continuing de-dollarization efforts. Dollar's share in global forex reserves slipped to two-decade low of ~58% by Q1 2025. US Dollar Index dropped 9.9% YTD September 2025. Skepticism about BRICS payment system viability due to internal contradictions, currency convertibility issues (yuan, rupee), and competing national interests. Assessment: no viable alternative to dollar exists currently, but facing creeping regional displacement.

**Key Points**: ["Trump threatens 100% tariffs on BRICS de-dollarization efforts", "Dollar reserve currency share declined to ~58% by Q1 2025 (two-decade low)", "BRICS internal contradictions limit effectiveness as anti-Western bloc", "Currency convertibility issues (yuan, rupee) hinder payment system", "No imminent dollar replacement but slow, gradual decline of dominance"]
