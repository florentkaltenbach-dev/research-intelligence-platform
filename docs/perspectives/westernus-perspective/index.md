## Perspectives by Event

### [Supply Chain Regionalization: $2.3 Trillion Semiconductor Fragmentation](/events/supply-chain-regionalization-23-trillion-semiconductor-fragmentation)

Frames supply chain regionalization as necessary despite economic costs. Pandemic and China risks proved overdependence vulnerability. Semiconductors framed as 'new oil' - too strategic to rely on geopolitical rivals. CHIPS Act and friend-shoring seen as insurance policy even if expensive. Critical minerals dependence on China identified as strategic liability - US 100% import-reliant on 12+ minerals. Taiwan vulnerability (90% advanced chips) drives geographic diversification urgency. Economic cost accepted as national security premium. Long-term: Expects allied blocs to achieve economies of scale, offsetting efficiency losses from China decoupling.

**Key Points**:
- Supply chain security worth economic cost
- Semiconductors = 'new oil', too strategic for rivals
- CHIPS Act insurance despite expense
- Critical minerals dependence = strategic liability
- Taiwan vulnerability drives diversification
- Allied blocs will achieve scale economies

### [AI Infrastructure Arms Race: $325 Billion Big Tech Investment in 2025](/events/ai-infrastructure-arms-race-325-billion-big-tech-investment-in-2025)

Frames as existential competition for technological leadership. Big Tech spending seen as necessary to maintain US dominance in AI - 'whoever wins AI wins everything' narrative. CHIPS Act and semiconductor investments framed as national security imperative. US controls 74% high-end AI compute, wants to maintain lead. DeepSeek shock (Jan 2025) caused investor panic but industry argues US approach necessary for frontier models. Views China as closing gap despite export controls. Semiconductor fragmentation necessary even if costly. Sees AI as defining 21st century like oil defined 20th.

**Key Points**:
- Big Tech $325B spending framed as necessary for leadership
- US 74% global AI compute, must maintain dominance
- DeepSeek raised efficiency questions but dismissed
- China closing gap despite export controls
- CHIPS Act: $2.3T investment as national security
- AI = 21st century oil analogy

### [Africa in Multipolar Order: 30% Critical Minerals & US-China Competition](/events/africa-in-multipolar-order-30-critical-minerals-us-china-competition)

Africa seen as critical battleground in great power competition, particularly for minerals essential to green energy transition. US/EU recognize late start vs China's decade-plus infrastructure/mining investments. Approach: Partnerships and 'values-based' investment emphasizing governance, transparency, labor standards vs Chinese model. Concerned about losing influence - China doesn't demand political reforms, making it attractive partner for African governments. Migration pressure from Africa to Europe adds urgency to engagement. Sees Africa's 54 UN votes as geopolitically significant. Strategy: Build Better World, Prosper Africa initiatives to counter BRI.

**Key Points**:
- Africa critical for green transition minerals
- Late start vs China decade-plus investments
- Partnership approach emphasizing governance/transparency
- China no-strings approach more attractive to African govts
- Migration concerns drive European engagement
- 54 UN votes geopolitically significant

### [India's Strategic Autonomy: Multi-Alignment Between Quad, Russia, and China](/events/indias-strategic-autonomy-multi-alignment-between-quad-russia-and-china)

US views India as vital to counter China's rise in Indo-Pacific, making India cornerstone of Quad strategy. Frustrated by India's refusal to condemn Russia over Ukraine and continued arms imports. Recognizes India needs 'strategic autonomy' but pushes for closer alignment. Sees India as future great power that could balance China if properly aligned. Concerned about India-China rapprochement undermining containment strategy. US defense cooperation with India growing but Russia remains 36% of India's weapons imports.

**Key Points**:
- India vital to Indo-Pacific strategy and Quad
- Frustrated by India neutrality on Russia-Ukraine
- US-India defense cooperation growing
- Concerns about India-China border agreement Oct 2024
- India strategic autonomy complicates US alliance structure
