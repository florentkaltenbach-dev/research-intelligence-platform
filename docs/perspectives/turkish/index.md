### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Turkey's control of Bosphorus provides unique strategic leverage unchanged since Byzantine era. 1936 Montreux Convention grants Turkey authority to regulate naval access to Black Sea via straits. February 2022: Turkey closed Bosphorus/Dardanelles to warships at Ukraine's request, preventing Russia from reinforcing Black Sea fleet - demonstrates concrete power from geographic control. Turkey balances between NATO membership and autonomous foreign policy ('Blue Homeland' doctrine). Trilateral Mine Countermeasures Task Group with Bulgaria/Romania makes Black Sea safer for Ukrainian grain exports. Same strategic location (Constantinople/'center of the world') valuable to Byzantines (330-1453), Ottomans (1453-1922), now Republic of Turkey - perfect illustration of geographical determinism across 1,700 years.

**Key Points**: ["Montreux Convention 1936: Turkey controls Black Sea naval access", "February 2022: closed straits prevented Russia reinforcing Black Sea fleet", "Balances NATO membership with autonomous 'Blue Homeland' doctrine", "Bosphorus strategically important 1,700 years: Byzantine\u2192Ottoman\u2192Turkish Republic", "Trilateral cooperation with Bulgaria/Romania for Black Sea security"]
