## Perspectives by Event

### [BRICS 17th Summit: Expansion and Payment System Development](/events/brics-17th-summit-expansion-and-payment-system-development)

India maintains strategic autonomy through multi-alignment strategy, engaging both BRICS (economic focus) and Quad (security focus). Back-to-back Quad foreign ministers meeting in Washington (July 1) and BRICS summit in Rio (July 6-7) highlighted increasingly difficult balancing act. Views BRICS primarily as economic rather than geopolitical grouping, unlike China and Russia. Resists any evolution toward formal military alliance that would compromise autonomy. Uses BRICS to hedge against US while using Quad to hedge against China.

**Key Points**:
- Multi-alignment prevents over-dependence on any single power
- BRICS supports India's global governance reform ambitions
- Strategic hedging: Quad for China deterrence, BRICS to maintain autonomy from US
- Any formal military alliance in Quad would be resisted by New Delhi
- Strategic autonomy is coherent doctrine, not fence-sitting

### [Indo-Pacific Military Realignments: AUKUS, Quad, and Rising China](/events/indo-pacific-military-realignments-aukus-quad-and-rising-china)

India navigates complex position between Quad (security) and strategic autonomy. Participated in Quad meeting Jan 21 but maintains multi-alignment: engaging both Quad and BRICS, both US and Russia. India resists any evolution of Quad toward formal military alliance that would compromise autonomy. Uses Quad for China deterrence and infrastructure support while maintaining independent Russia relationship and BRICS engagement. At 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue, Indian perspective aligned with broader regional view: prefer pragmatic interests-based approach over zero-sum great-power rivalry. Skeptical of US 5% GDP defense spending demands.

**Key Points**:
- Quad engagement for China deterrence, not formal military alliance
- Multi-alignment: Quad + BRICS, US + Russia simultaneously
- Shangri-La Dialogue: prefer pragmatic over zero-sum rivalry
- Resist US pressure for 5% GDP defense spending
- Strategic autonomy doctrine: issue-based diplomacy, avoid over-dependence

### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

India's geographic position as crossroads of Indian Ocean provides inherent strategic advantage. 7,500km coastline, 2.37M sq km EEZ, 95% trade by volume (74% by value) travels via Indian Ocean. PM Modi 2015: 'India is at crossroads of Indian Ocean.' 2025: India chairs IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association) and IONS (Indian Ocean Naval Symposium), hosts Quad summit - 'India's maritime moment.' Western Indian Ocean (Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb, Mozambique Channel) directly impacts India's security/trade. Strategic position between Middle East, Central Asia, Southeast Asia gives India options for multi-alignment. Geography enables India's balancing strategy: engage Quad (security) and BRICS (economic) simultaneously. Ignoring Indian Ocean focus would leave India vulnerable to strategic encirclement despite technological advances.

**Key Points**:
- 7,500km coastline, 2.37M sq km EEZ, 95% trade volume via Indian Ocean
- 2025: India chairs IORA and IONS, hosts Quad summit - maritime moment
- Crossroads position enables multi-alignment: Quad + BRICS simultaneously
- Western Indian Ocean chokepoints (Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb) vital to security
- Geographic position prevents strategic encirclement, enables balancing
