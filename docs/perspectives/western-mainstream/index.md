### [El Salvador Bitcoin Experiment Reversal: IMF-Mandated Rollback](/events/el-salvador-bitcoin-experiment-reversal-imf-mandated-rollback)

Near-universal framing as failed experiment: only 8.1% used Bitcoin, 80% never used it, 1% of remittances via crypto. IMF $1.4B loan conditional on removing Bitcoin as legal tender. Western economists emphasize volatility, lack of adoption, fiscal irresponsibility. Presents as cautionary tale against cryptocurrency hype and populist economic policies, with CAR parallel failure reinforcing narrative.

**Key Points**:
- January 30, 2025: Congress voted 55-2 to repeal legal tender status
- Only 8.1% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin (down from 25.7% year 1)
- 1.1% of remittances via crypto (0.87% by Dec 2024)
- IMF $1.4B loan conditional on rollback
- Central African Republic also failed after 1 year (2022-2023)

### [Islamic Finance Growth to $6 Trillion (Projected $9.7T by 2029)](/events/islamic-finance-growth-to-6-trillion-projected-97t-by-2029)

Generally overlooked or minimized in mainstream Western coverage despite $6T scale (larger than many G20 economies). When covered, presents as niche market or specialty finance. Acknowledges sukuk growth (+25.6% to $230.4B in 2024) but rarely contextualizes as parallel financial architecture operating at scale. Tends to emphasize exotic Shariah compliance requirements as barriers rather than features.

**Key Points**:
- $6T scale rarely contextualized in Western media
- Treated as niche despite exceeding many G20 economies
- Sukuk growth acknowledged but not systemic significance
- Shariah compliance framed as exotic/complex
- Parallel financial architecture aspect ignored

**Key Points**:
- BRICS Pay prototype shown October 2024 but not operational
- Implementation now targeted for 2030 (delayed)
