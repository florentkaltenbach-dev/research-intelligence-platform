### [US-China Semiconductor War: Export Control Reversals and Escalation](/events/us-china-semiconductor-war-export-control-reversals-and-escalation)

Analysts argue US restrictions harm American tech leadership rather than effectively containing China. Export controls reduce US companies' global market share and R&D revenues. China's semiconductor progress continues despite restrictions, with companies finding workarounds. The July 2025 reversal on design software and August Nvidia deal reflect industry pressure and recognition that overly broad controls hurt US more than China. However, enforcement remains challenging with smuggling operations ($390M ring discovered). Technology competition accelerating global fragmentation of semiconductor supply chains, with regional blocs forming. Long-term: tech restrictions push faster Chinese indigenization.

**Key Points**:
- Restrictions harm US tech leadership more than contain China
- Export controls reduce US companies' market share and R&D funding
- July/August reversals reflect industry pressure and policy pragmatism
- Enforcement challenges: sophisticated smuggling operations persist
- Accelerating supply chain fragmentation and regional blocs
