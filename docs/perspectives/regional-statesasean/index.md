### [Indo-Pacific Military Realignments: AUKUS, Quad, and Rising China](/events/indo-pacific-military-realignments-aukus-quad-and-rising-china)

2025 Shangri-La Dialogue revealed disconnect between great powers and regional states. Middle powers and small states favor pragmatic, interests-based approach over zero-sum great-power rivalry. Little enthusiasm for US Defense Secretary Hegseth's 5% GDP spending call. Regional states prefer 'options, not sides' - maintaining economic ties with China while seeking security cooperation with US/allies. Concern that AUKUS militarization and Quad activities could destabilize region and force unwanted choices. Preference for ASEAN-centered multilateralism over bilateral US alliances. Fear of becoming proxy battleground in US-China competition.

**Key Points**:
- Shangri-La Dialogue 2025: regional states reject zero-sum great-power logic
- 'Options, not sides' - maintain China economic ties + US security cooperation
- Little enthusiasm for US 5% GDP defense spending demands
- Preference for ASEAN-centered multilateralism vs bilateral US alliances
- Fear of becoming proxy battleground in US-China competition
