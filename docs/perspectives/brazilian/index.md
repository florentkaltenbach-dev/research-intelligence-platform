### [BRICS 17th Summit: Expansion and Payment System Development](/events/brics-17th-summit-expansion-and-payment-system-development)

Brazil's President Lula emphasized BRICS as a force for peace and multipolar governance reform under the theme 'Strengthening Global South Cooperation for More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance.' Brazil promoted 'Active Non-Alignment' doctrine, balancing between US and China. Concerns about rapid expansion diluting Brazil's influence and making BRICS appear Sino-centric rather than Global South-oriented. Emphasized BRICS economic performance: 4% growth vs 3.3% global average in 2024.

**Key Points**:
- BRICS must become a force capable of promoting peace and mediating conflicts
- Fundamental reform of UN Security Council needed for legitimacy and democracy
- 'Friends for Peace' group (China-Brazil led) aims to end conflicts like Ukraine
- Expansion risks diluting founding members' influence
- Maintain balance between Washington and Beijing under Active Non-Alignment
