## Perspectives by Event

### [BRICS 17th Summit: Expansion and Payment System Development](/events/brics-17th-summit-expansion-and-payment-system-development)

China views BRICS as cornerstone of multipolar world order without Western hegemony. At 2025 Munich Security Conference, Foreign Minister Wang Yi defined multipolarity as 'equality among all countries regardless of size' with equal voice in multilateral institutions. Emphasizes non-interference in sovereign affairs, diversity of civilizations, and opposition to 'Cold War mentality' and 'bullying practices.' Xi Jinping's vision: world where US hegemony is 'thing of the past' and liberalism/democracy are no longer sacrosanct.

**Key Points**:
- Multipolarity means equality without imperialism or hegemony, abiding by UN Charter
- Oppose hegemonism, Cold War mentality, and bullying practices
- US will succumb to tensions between global responsibilities and domestic care
- China does not aspire to same hegemony US once enjoyed
- Rally Global South support for reformed global order

### [China Weaponizes Rare Earth Supply Chain with Export Controls](/events/china-weaponizes-rare-earth-supply-chain-with-export-controls)

China views rare earth controls as legitimate response to US weaponization of semiconductors and CHIPS Act restrictions. April 2025 restrictions on 7 heavy rare earths (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium) were direct retaliation for Trump's new tariffs. October 2025 expansion targets military applications, applying foreign direct product rule for first time. China emphasizes this mirrors US tactics. Controls affect gallium (95% from China), germanium, antimony, tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, molybdenum. Seen as leveraging China's natural resource advantage in technology competition.

**Key Points**:
- Rare earth controls legitimate response to US semiconductor weaponization
- China produces 70% of rare earth mining, 90%+ refining, 92% of NdFeB magnets
- First Chinese use of FDPR mirrors US tactics
- December 1, 2025: foreign military-affiliated companies denied licenses
- Gallium (95% Chinese), germanium, antimony restricted to US

### [US-China Semiconductor War: Export Control Reversals and Escalation](/events/us-china-semiconductor-war-export-control-reversals-and-escalation)

China views US export controls as 'abuse' and economic coercion, calling out Trump administration in May 2025. Weaponized dominance in rare earths critical for semiconductors in response: expanded export controls October 2025 requiring government approval for designated rare earths. Export bans on gallium, antimony, germanium (indispensable for advanced semiconductors). China accelerating self-sufficiency drive despite US restrictions. However, 98% of Chinese banks rejected direct yuan payments from Russia due to secondary sanctions concerns, showing vulnerability to US financial pressure. China's semiconductor progress despite controls demonstrates limits of US restrictions.

**Key Points**:
- China calls out Trump for 'abuse' of semiconductor export controls (May 2025)
- Weaponized rare earth dominance in retaliation
- Export bans: gallium, antimony, germanium (critical for semiconductors)
- Self-sufficiency drive accelerating despite US restrictions
- Vulnerability: 98% of Chinese banks reject Russia yuan payments (secondary sanctions fear)

### [Dollar Weaponization Accelerates Global De-dollarization Trends](/events/dollar-weaponization-accelerates-global-de-dollarization-trends)

China cautiously pursues yuan internationalization without directly challenging dollar dominance. 90% of Russia-China trade in yuan/rubles demonstrates progress. September 2025: inaugurated international operations centre for digital yuan in Shanghai. Project mBridge connects banks in China, Thailand, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia for wholesale CBDC cross-border payments. However, yuan's proportion in global reserves remains limited. Yuan not fully convertible, capital controls persist. 98% of Chinese banks rejected Russia yuan payments shows China prioritizes US financial system access over challenging dollar. Strategy: gradual yuan internationalization in friendly markets, not frontal assault on dollar hegemony.

**Key Points**:
- 90% Russia-China trade in yuan/rubles, gradual internationalization
- September 2025: digital yuan international operations centre in Shanghai
- Project mBridge: China, Thailand, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia
- Yuan not fully convertible, capital controls limit global use
- 98% banks reject Russia yuan payments - prioritize US system access

### [Indo-Pacific Military Realignments: AUKUS, Quad, and Rising China](/events/indo-pacific-military-realignments-aukus-quad-and-rising-china)

China views AUKUS and Quad as US-led containment strategy threatening regional stability. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun warned AUKUS moves heighten tensions, raise nuclear proliferation risks, contribute to arms race. China's military response: expanding from 600+ warheads now to target of 1,000 by 2030. In October 2024, China committed to 20% of UN General Budget (just behind US 22%), signaling global governance ambitions. China frames US actions as 'Cold War mentality' and 'hegemonic practices.' Emphasizes peaceful rise and opposes 'unilateral actions' - countering Quad language. Chinese perspective: regional states should pursue independent development paths without foreign interference.

**Key Points**:
- AUKUS heightens tensions, nuclear proliferation risks, arms race
- China expanding from 600+ to 1,000 warheads by 2030 in response
- China 20% UN budget (Oct 2024) signals global governance commitment
- US actions represent 'Cold War mentality' and hegemonic containment
- Regional states should pursue independent paths without foreign interference

### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

China faces 'Malacca Dilemma': 80% of oil imports traverse Indian Ocean and Strait of Malacca, vulnerable to potential US naval blockade during conflict. BRI viewed as strategy to lessen chokepoint vulnerability. Solutions: (1) Kyaukpyu in Myanmar with pipelines to Kunming - cuts 700 miles, avoids Malacca; (2) Sino-Malaysian alliance developing Port of Malacca as largest in Southeast Asia by 2025; (3) Djibouti naval base (China's only foreign base) near Bab el-Mandeb/Suez; (4) Stakes in Egypt's Port Said, Ain Sokhna, $6.75B Suez Canal Economic Zone deal (2023). BRI echoes Mackinder's Heartland warnings: rail infrastructure to wean trade off maritime routes under US naval threat. Geography drives Chinese grand strategy.

**Key Points**:
- Malacca Dilemma: 80% oil imports vulnerable to US blockade
- Myanmar Kyaukpyu: pipelines to Kunming, avoid Malacca, cut 700 miles
- Djibouti: China's only foreign naval base, controls Bab el-Mandeb/Suez access
- Egypt: Port Said, Ain Sokhna stakes, $6.75B Suez deal 2023
- Rail infrastructure (BRI) reduces vulnerability to US naval dominance

### [Energy Transition Geopolitics: Critical Minerals Competition Intensifies](/events/energy-transition-geopolitics-critical-minerals-competition-intensifies)

China views critical minerals dominance as strategic advantage in technology competition and energy transition. Controls 85-90% rare earth refining, 68% cobalt, 65% nickel, 60% lithium, 95% gallium. Dominant in downstream: 92% of NdFeB magnets, solar panel/battery component supply chains. This dominance result of decades of investment and industrial policy while West pursued financialization. China willing to weaponize this advantage: October 2025 expanded rare earth export controls, gallium/germanium/antimony export bans. As US weaponized semiconductors, China weaponizes materials. Green transition runs through China - 84% of renewables stakeholders report geopolitical delays. China's message: technology competition is two-way street.

**Key Points**:
- Critical minerals dominance: 85-90% rare earth refining, 68% cobalt, 65% nickel, 60% lithium
- Downstream control: 92% NdFeB magnets, solar/battery supply chains
- Decades of investment while West pursued financialization
- October 2025: weaponized via export controls, matching US semiconductor tactics
- 84% renewables projects face delays - green transition runs through China

### [China-Brokered Saudi-Iran Rapprochement: Middle East Realignment](/events/china-brokered-saudi-iran-rapprochement-middle-east-realignment)

China views Saudi-Iran mediation as proof of alternative diplomatic model: economic partnerships enabling honest broker role without military threats or regime change demands. Success based on 'power of not using power' - leveraging geoeconomic influence (largest trade partner for both, major oil imports from both) without coercion. Xi Jinping's December 2022 Riyadh visit for first Chinese-Arab summit created opportunity to offer Beijing hosting. China's approach: respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, focus on mutual economic interests. Demonstrates China can deliver diplomatic results without US military presence. Model for Global South engagement and multipolar order where multiple powers can mediate regional conflicts.

**Key Points**:
- Proof of alternative diplomatic model: economic partnerships enable mediation
- 'Power of not using power' - geoeconomic leverage without coercion
- Largest trade partner for both Saudi and Iran, major oil importer
- Non-interference, sovereignty respect, mutual economic interests
- First Middle East mediation demonstrates multipolar diplomacy
