### [China Weaponizes Rare Earth Supply Chain with Export Controls](/events/china-weaponizes-rare-earth-supply-chain-with-export-controls)

US views China's rare earth restrictions as strategic threat to defense supply chains and clean energy transition. F-35s, submarines, Tomahawks, radar systems, UAVs depend on rare earths. European Commission President von der Leyen accused China of 'weaponizing' control over critical materials. G7 launched Critical Minerals Action Plan. US countermeasures: $400M DoD equity investment in MP Materials (largest shareholder), 10-year price floor of $110/kg for NdPr products. However, achieving supply chain resilience requires sustained long-term investment. Non-Chinese separation capacity projected to reach only 25-30% by 2027.

**Key Points**: ["Critical threat to defense: F-35, Virginia/Columbia submarines, Tomahawks", "Von der Leyen: China 'weaponizing' critical materials", "DoD $400M investment in MP Materials, now largest shareholder", "G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan launched", "Non-Chinese capacity: 25-30% by 2027, still far from self-sufficiency"]
