## Perspectives by Event

### [Supply Chain Regionalization: $2.3 Trillion Semiconductor Fragmentation](/events/supply-chain-regionalization-23-trillion-semiconductor-fragmentation)

Small states see opportunity and risk in regionalization. Vietnam, Mexico benefit from friend-shoring (TSMC, Apple supply chain shifts). Singapore positioned as neutral hub between blocs. Risk: Forced to choose sides could damage economic model based on serving all markets. Manufacturing capacity moves create jobs but technology transfer limited vs previous globalization era. Critical minerals producers (DRC cobalt, Chile lithium, Indonesia nickel) gain leverage but face pressure to align with blocs. Overall strategy: Maximize benefits from multiple relationships while delaying forced choice as long as possible. Sees regionalization as managed correctly could increase middle power influence.

**Key Points**:
- Vietnam/Mexico benefit from friend-shoring
- Singapore aims to stay neutral hub
- Risk: Forced choice could damage open economy model
- Tech transfer more limited than previous globalization
- Mineral producers gain leverage but face bloc pressure
- Strategy: Maximize multi-alignment, delay forced choice
