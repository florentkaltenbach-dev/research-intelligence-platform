### [China-Brokered Saudi-Iran Rapprochement: Middle East Realignment](/events/china-brokered-saudi-iran-rapprochement-middle-east-realignment)

Saudi Arabia pragmatically pursued rapprochement to reduce regional tensions and focus on Vision 2030 economic transformation. Seven-year rivalry with Iran consumed resources and attention. MBS recognized need for regional stability to attract investment. China's offer to host provided face-saving mechanism - neutral venue, economic partner with interests in both sides. Saudi calculation: US increasingly unreliable (Trump's abandonment concerns, Biden's human rights pressure), China offers stable partnership without political conditions. Rapprochement enabled by Saudi confidence from military modernization and regional position. Risk management: hedge against US withdrawal by improving relations with Iran while maintaining US security ties. Opened space for Yemen de-escalation.

**Key Points**:
- Regional stability needed for Vision 2030 economic transformation
- Seven-year rivalry consumed resources, reduced investment attractiveness
- China neutral venue, face-saving mechanism, stable partner
- US increasingly unreliable: Trump abandonment fears, Biden rights pressure
- Hedging strategy: improve Iran relations while maintaining US security ties
