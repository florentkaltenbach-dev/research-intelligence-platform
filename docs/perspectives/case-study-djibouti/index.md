### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Djibouti exemplifies perfect geographical continuity across millennia. Ancient: Land of Punt traded with Egyptian pharaohs, caravans crossed for 2,000+ years carrying coffee/gold/ivory/hides between African interior and coast. Colonial: Railway Djibouti-Addis Ababa (early 1900s) followed ancient caravan paths. Modern: Bab el-Mandeb strait (25km) controls 30% global container traffic, 10% petroleum, Suez Canal access. Military bases: France (1,450 troops, largest overseas presence), US (5,000+, only Africa base), China (first overseas base, 2017), Japan (first post-WWII overseas base), Italy. Rent from foreign militaries: $125M+/year. Same location, different empires, identical strategic logic spanning 3,000+ years.

**Key Points**:
- Ancient: Land of Punt/Egypt trade, 2,000+ years of caravans
- Colonial: railway followed ancient paths (early 1900s)
- Modern: Bab el-Mandeb 30% containers, 10% petroleum, Suez access
- Bases: France (1,450), US (5,000+), China (2017), Japan, Italy
- $125M+/year rent - geography monetized continuously for millennia
