## Perspectives by Event

### [China Weaponizes Rare Earth Supply Chain with Export Controls](/events/china-weaponizes-rare-earth-supply-chain-with-export-controls)

EU deeply concerned about rare earth dependence for green transition and defense. 84% of renewable energy stakeholders say geopolitical challenges causing substantial delays or abandonment of projects. China controls supply chains for solar panels, battery components, critical minerals. Rare earths fundamental to wind turbines, EV motors, defense tech. EU caught between US-China competition, seeking supply diversification but facing concentration trends: average market share of top 3 refining nations rose from 82% (2020) to 86% (2024). Von der Leyen calls for united G7 response to weaponization.

**Key Points**:
- 84% of renewables stakeholders report geopolitical delays/cancellations
- Rare earths critical for wind turbines, EV motors, solar infrastructure
- Supply concentration increased 2020-2024 despite diversification efforts
- EU caught between US-China tech competition
- Green transition threatened by China's supply chain dominance

### [European Strategic Autonomy: Trump's Return Forces Defense Reckoning](/events/european-strategic-autonomy-trumps-return-forces-defense-reckoning)

Europe faces 'watershed moment' (von der Leyen) as Trump's unreliability forces strategic autonomy from operational concept to necessity. March 6, 2025: 27 EU leaders endorsed 'Rearm Europe' plan. Greek PM Mitsotakis: 'strategic autonomy must be non-negotiable priority.' Defense spending surging: €279B (2023) → €343B (2024) → €381B projected (2025), exceeding 2% GDP for first time. However, critical dilemma: investing in US equipment (64% of imports 2020-2024) provides Trump leverage via future dependence. Need European defense industrial base, but timeline challenging. Political/military leaders adjusting to future where US cannot be trusted. Shared procurement, command structures, regional defense compacts emerging.

**Key Points**:
- March 6, 2025: 'Rearm Europe' plan endorsed - 'watershed moment'
- Defense spending: €343B (2024) → €381B (2025), first time >2% GDP
- Dilemma: 64% arms from US (2020-2024) - investment risks deeper dependence
- Strategic autonomy shifts from concept to operational necessity
- Joint procurement, shared commands, regional compacts emerging

### [Energy Transition Geopolitics: Critical Minerals Competition Intensifies](/events/energy-transition-geopolitics-critical-minerals-competition-intensifies)

EU in particularly difficult position: committed to aggressive climate targets but dependent on China for critical minerals AND solar panels AND battery components. Von der Leyen's 'weaponization' accusation highlights concern but alternatives limited. EU caught between US-China competition: US pressures Europe to decouple from China, but green transition timeline doesn't allow decade-long supply chain restructuring. 84% of renewables stakeholders face delays - threatens EU Green Deal timeline. Europe seeking third way: partnerships with Africa, Latin America for mining, but refining capacity takes years to build. Risk: EU climate ambitions become casualty of US-China great power competition.

**Key Points**:
- Aggressive climate targets but Chinese supply chain dependence
- Von der Leyen: China 'weaponizing' but alternatives limited
- Caught between US pressure to decouple and green transition urgency
- 84% renewables delays threaten EU Green Deal timeline
- Seeking African/Latin American partnerships but refining takes years
