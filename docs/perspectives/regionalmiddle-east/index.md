### [China-Brokered Saudi-Iran Rapprochement: Middle East Realignment](/events/china-brokered-saudi-iran-rapprochement-middle-east-realignment)

Regional states view rapprochement positively as reducing sectarian tensions and conflict risk. Yemen particularly benefited: Saudi-Iran de-escalation opened space for peace negotiations. Iraq and Oman see vindication: their 2021-2022 mediation laid groundwork despite China getting credit for final agreement. UAE, which had already normalized Israel relations and engaged Iran pragmatically, sees trend toward economic pragmatism over ideological confrontation. Regional smaller states welcome reduced Saudi-Iran rivalry - forced to take sides in proxy conflicts from Syria to Yemen. Hope: great power competition (US vs China) creates space for regional autonomy as both compete for partnerships rather than imposing alignment.

**Key Points**: ["Reduced sectarian tensions, conflict risk across region", "Yemen benefited: Saudi-Iran de-escalation enabled peace negotiations", "Iraq/Oman vindicated: their 2021-2022 mediation laid groundwork", "Trend toward economic pragmatism over ideological confrontation", "Smaller states welcome reduced rivalry, hope for autonomous space"]
