### [Central Bank Gold Accumulation: 1,000+ Tonnes Annually for Three Consecutive Years](/events/central-bank-gold-accumulation-1000-tonnes-annually-for-three-consecutive-years)

RBI gold holdings reached 800.78 tonnes (8% of reserves) by September 2023, adding 73t in 2024. Indian analysis presents as dual dynamic where official and consumer demand reinforce each other - cultural affinity meeting monetary policy. Frames gold accumulation as consistent with India 5,000-year gold culture while modernizing reserve management. Less explicitly geopolitical than Russian narrative, emphasizing prudent diversification.

**Key Points**:
- RBI holds 800.78t (8% of total reserves)
- Added 73 tonnes in 2024
- Cultural-institutional synthesis approach
- 5,000-year gold cultural tradition
- Modernizing reserve management while honoring tradition
