## Perspectives by Event

### [Dollar Weaponization Accelerates Global De-dollarization Trends](/events/dollar-weaponization-accelerates-global-de-dollarization-trends)

Global South increasingly views dollar dependence as vulnerability after Russian asset freeze demonstrated US willingness to weaponize financial system even against major economies. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath advises developing countries opt for non-alignment to benefit from new Cold War. India, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkey trading with Russia in non-dollar currencies despite US pressure. However, practical alternatives limited: no currency offers dollar's combination of liquidity, stability, and institutional backing. Result: pragmatic hedging - maintain dollar reserves while diversifying and developing regional payment systems. Emphasis on financial sovereignty and reducing exposure to unilateral sanctions.

**Key Points**: ["Russian freeze showed US will weaponize against major economies", "IMF Gopinath: developing countries should opt for non-alignment benefits", "India, Saudi, UAE, Turkey trading with Russia in local currencies", "No viable full alternative to dollar yet exists", "Strategy: pragmatic hedging and regional payment system development"]
