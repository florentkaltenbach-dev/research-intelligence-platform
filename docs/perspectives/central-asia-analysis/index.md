### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Central Asia as Mackinder's 'Heartland' continuously contested: 'whoever controlled Central Asia would be dominant world power.' Historical: Ancient Silk Road empires competed for Central Asian control. 19th century: 'Great Game' between British and Russian Empires for Central Asian dominance. Post-Soviet: US brief dominance post-9/11. Current 'New Great Game': China emerging as 'big winner,' displacing US and Russia. Xi Jinping's 2013 Central Asian tour positioned region as 'crucial nexus for cross-regional trade, investment, infrastructure.' Russia-China 'axis of convenience' turning to rivalry as China replaces Russia on geo-economic and energy assets. US 'shadow of early 2000s.' Geography unchanged; great powers rotate. Mackinder's 1904 Heartland prediction still governing 2025 competition.

**Key Points**: ["Mackinder 1904: whoever controls Central Asia dominates world", "Historical: ancient Silk Road empires \u2192 19th century Great Game (Britain-Russia)", "Post-9/11: US brief dominance, now 'shadow of early 2000s'", "New Great Game: China 'big winner,' displacing US and Russia", "Russia-China axis of convenience \u2192 rivalry as China dominates economically"]
