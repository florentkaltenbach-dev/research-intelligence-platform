### [Energy Transition Geopolitics: Critical Minerals Competition Intensifies](/events/energy-transition-geopolitics-critical-minerals-competition-intensifies)

Resource-rich developing nations (Africa, Latin America) see opportunity in energy transition: possess raw materials but historically exploited via extraction without value-added processing. Learning from China's playbook: seeking to develop domestic refining capacity, not just mining. NDB (BRICS) offers alternative financing to Western institutions. However, challenges: refining requires technical expertise, environmental standards, massive capital investment. Risk of new dependency: China investing heavily in Global South mining operations - could replicate extractive patterns under different flag. Opportunity: leverage great power competition to negotiate better terms. Sovereignty concern: critical minerals becoming new oil - geopolitical curse?

**Key Points**: ["Possess raw materials but historically exploited without value-added", "Learning from China: develop refining capacity, not just mining", "BRICS NDB offers alternative to Western conditional financing", "Challenge: refining requires expertise, capital, environmental standards", "Risk: Chinese investment could replicate extraction under different flag"]
