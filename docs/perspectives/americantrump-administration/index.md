### [European Strategic Autonomy: Trump's Return Forces Defense Reckoning](/events/european-strategic-autonomy-trumps-return-forces-defense-reckoning)

Trump demands 5% GDP defense spending from NATO allies, significant increase from 2% target. Only Estonia and Lithuania pledged 5% so far. Trump's message: US will not subsidize European defense while they spend on social programs. America First doctrine questions US commitment to Article 5. However, contradictions: demands higher spending but benefits if Europeans buy American weapons (64% of EU imports 2020-2024). Trump's approach: transactional relationship replacing traditional alliance solidarity. Defense Secretary Hegseth pushes 5% target but European response lukewarm. Trump's unpredictability and threats to withdraw from NATO have opposite effect: forcing Europe toward autonomy rather than increased burden-sharing.

**Key Points**:
- Trump demands 5% GDP target (vs 2% previously), only Estonia/Lithuania pledged
- America First questions Article 5 commitment, traditional alliance solidarity
- Contradiction: demands spending but benefits from 64% US arms imports
- Transactional relationship replaces solidarity-based alliance
- Unpredictability forcing European autonomy, not just burden-sharing
