### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Panama Canal: 5% of global trade, vital route for US Navy, 72% of transiting ships to/from US ports. Geographic chokepoint competition between US and China. January 2025: Trump declared China 'controls' Panama Canal, must 'take it back.' Chinese entities operated key infrastructure both canal ends since 1997. March 2025: BlackRock acquired 80% stake in Hutchison Port Holdings ($22.8B), Trump claimed gives American consortium 'control over keys to Panama Canal.' Panama became first Latin American country to officially exit BRI. Latin American battleground: China's BRI intensifying regional presence vs US Monroe Doctrine sensibilities. Geographic determinism illustrated: 19th century US interventions in Panama (1903 independence from Colombia to secure canal zone) echoed by 21st century US-China competition over same strategic location. Geography unchanged; competing powers' names changed.

**Key Points**:
- Panama Canal: 5% global trade, 72% ships to/from US ports, vital for US Navy
- Chinese entities operated key infrastructure both ends since 1997
- Jan 2025: Trump claimed China controls canal; Mar 2025: BlackRock $22.8B deal
- Panama exited BRI, first Latin American country to do so
- 19th century US interventions → 21st century US-China competition, same location
