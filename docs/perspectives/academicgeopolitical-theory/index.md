### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Mackinder's Heartland Theory (1904): 'Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; who rules the World-Island commands the world.' Heartland = Volga to Yangtze, Arctic to Himalayas. Spykman's Rimland Theory (1942) countered: 'Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia, who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.' Both theories demonstrate geographical determinism: geography is most fundamental factor shaping state foreign policy. Admiral Fisher's 'five keys to the world': Dover, Gibraltar, Suez, Malacca, Cape of Good Hope - identified in 1900s, remain critical today. These theories predicted current competition 100+ years ago based solely on geography.

**Key Points**: ["Mackinder 1904 Heartland Theory: Central Asia control = world dominance", "Spykman 1942 Rimland Theory: littoral areas key to controlling center", "Geographical determinism: geography shapes foreign policy fundamentally", "Admiral Fisher's 'five keys': Dover, Gibraltar, Suez, Malacca, Cape - still critical 120+ years later", "Classical theories predicted modern competition based on permanent geography"]
