## Perspectives by Event

### [European Strategic Autonomy: Trump's Return Forces Defense Reckoning](/events/european-strategic-autonomy-trumps-return-forces-defense-reckoning)

Analysts see 2025 as potential turning point for European defense but skeptical of follow-through. Positive: spending increasing, 'Rearm Europe' plan, political rhetoric shifting. Negative: 64% arms from US means buying European risks inefficiency/duplication while buying American deepens dependence. €630B/year at 3.5% target is massive increase - political sustainability questionable across election cycles. Key challenge: building European defense industrial base from decades of underinvestment requires 10-15 year timeline, but political urgency driven by Trump may not last. Risk: increased spending without strategic coherence produces capability gaps. Opportunity: if sustained, could create genuine European pillar in NATO or alternative.

**Key Points**: ["Potential turning point but skeptical of sustained follow-through", "64% US arms: buying European = inefficiency, buying American = dependence", "\u20ac630B/year (3.5%) massive increase - political sustainability uncertain", "Building industrial base from underinvestment requires 10-15 years", "Risk: increased spending without strategic coherence creates gaps"]
