## Perspectives by Event

### [US-China Semiconductor War: Export Control Reversals and Escalation](/events/us-china-semiconductor-war-export-control-reversals-and-escalation)

US semiconductor policy under Trump marked by contradictory moves balancing national security with industry pressure. Tightening measures: Entity List additions (65 total in 2025), equipment/software restrictions. But July 2025 reversal on design software and August deal allowing Nvidia China sales (with 15% government revenue cut) signal pragmatic approach. CHIPS Act implementation proceeding: first subsidy December 2023, Biden rushed $53B more post-election. However, predicted shortfall of 300,000 engineers and 90,000 technicians by 2030. CHIPS 2.0 unlikely. Enforcement challenges: $390M 'Luxuriate Your Life' smuggling ring discovered.

**Key Points**: ["65 Chinese entities added to Entity List in 2025", "July: lifted chip design software restrictions (Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens)", "August: Nvidia China sales allowed with 15% revenue to US government", "CHIPS Act: 300K engineer shortage predicted by 2030", "$390M GPU smuggling operation discovered (Dell/Supermicro servers to Malaysia)"]

### [Indo-Pacific Military Realignments: AUKUS, Quad, and Rising China](/events/indo-pacific-military-realignments-aukus-quad-and-rising-china)

US views Indo-Pacific security architecture as essential for containing China's rise. Trump administration calls AUKUS 'full steam ahead' despite scrutiny. Key achievements: Australia to receive 200+ Tomahawks by end 2025, $1.6B Australian contribution to US submarine production capacity, $8B Henderson shipyard upgrades enabling US/UK rotations. Quad meeting Jan 21, 2025 reaffirmed 'iron-clad commitment' to free and open Indo-Pacific. Notable: omitted Korean Peninsula denuclearization commitment (policy shift). However, Defense Secretary Hegseth's call for 5% GDP defense spending met with little regional enthusiasm, exposing limits of US demands.

**Key Points**: ["AUKUS 'full steam ahead' - Trump Pentagon review passed", "200+ Tomahawks to Australia by end 2025, hypersonic tests proceeding", "Australia $1.6B to US shipyards increases production 1.2 to 2.3 boats/year", "Quad omitted Korean denuclearization commitment (US policy shift)", "Hegseth 5% GDP call met with little enthusiasm - limits of US pressure"]

### [Dollar Weaponization Accelerates Global De-dollarization Trends](/events/dollar-weaponization-accelerates-global-de-dollarization-trends)

US views de-dollarization as existential threat to 'exorbitant privilege' - ability to print world's reserve currency. Trump administration renewed 100% tariff threats on BRICS nations pursuing de-dollarization. However, weaponization via Russian asset freeze ($300B February 2022) catalyzed very trend US fears. Dollar Index dropped 9.9% YTD September 2025. Reserve currency share at two-decade low (~58% Q1 2025). Heritage Foundation warns 'woke' sanctions and dollar abandonment will ruin world, not just US. Federal Reserve 2025 report acknowledges creeping regional displacement but maintains no imminent collapse risk. US faces dilemma: sanctions are powerful tool but overuse accelerates de-dollarization.

**Key Points**: ["Trump threatens 100% tariffs on de-dollarization efforts", "Dollar Index -9.9% YTD September, reserves at ~58% (20-year low)", "Russian asset freeze ($300B) catalyzed global de-dollarization concerns", "Fed 2025: creeping regional displacement, not imminent collapse", "Dilemma: sanctions powerful but overuse accelerates dollar abandonment"]

### [China-Brokered Saudi-Iran Rapprochement: Middle East Realignment](/events/china-brokered-saudi-iran-rapprochement-middle-east-realignment)

US views Saudi-Iran rapprochement with concern as symbol of declining Middle East influence and China's rising diplomatic role. Agreement reached without US involvement in region long considered American sphere. Represents failure of Maximum Pressure on Iran and questions about US reliability as Saudi security partner. However, some analysts argue China's role was modest - mediation by Iraq/Oman (2021-2022) did heavy lifting, China just hosted final signing. Concern: trend of US disengagement (Afghanistan, Syria) creating vacuum China fills not via military but via economic partnerships and neutral mediation. Long-term worry: if China can mediate conflicts, US military presence justification weakens.

**Key Points**: ["Symbol of declining Middle East influence, China's rising diplomatic role", "Agreement without US in region long considered American sphere", "Represents Maximum Pressure failure, questions about US reliability", "Debate: China's role modest (Iraq/Oman did heavy lifting) vs significant", "Trend: US disengagement creates vacuum China fills via economics/diplomacy"]

### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

US inherited British naval dominance of strategic chokepoints post-WWII. Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti: only enduring US military installation in Africa, 5,000+ personnel, controls Bab el-Mandeb (30% global container traffic, 10% petroleum). Persian Gulf: 125,000 US troops near Iran (2012 CENTCOM), bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar - locations overlapping historical Persian/Ottoman control. Mediterranean: NATO operations in region continuously strategic since Rome/Byzantine/Ottoman periods. However, US position declining: China's Djibouti base (2017) directly adjacent to US Camp Lemonnier. In Central Asia, US 'clearly a shadow of what it was in early 2000s.' Geography constant; US hegemony contestable.

**Key Points**: ["Djibouti Camp Lemonnier: only enduring US Africa base, 5,000+ personnel", "Persian Gulf: 125,000 troops (2012), Kuwait/Bahrain/Qatar bases", "Mediterranean: NATO in historically strategic Rome/Byzantine/Ottoman region", "Decline: China's Djibouti base (2017) adjacent to US facility", "Central Asia: US 'shadow of early 2000s' - geographic advantage lost"]
