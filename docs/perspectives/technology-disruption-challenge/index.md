### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Do space satellites, cyber capabilities, hypersonic missiles overcome geographical determinism? Partial yes, but geography still foundational. Space satellites: enable ISR across oceans, GPS for precision weapons, communications across global distances, coordinate unmanned systems - command of space enables command of sea. Hypersonic missiles: strike anywhere on planet within minutes, glide/change course (hard to intercept), compress decision timelines. Chinese satellite network described as 'kill web' providing hypersonic targeting. Cyber: China uses capabilities for intelligence collection, economic/military advantage. However, technology augments rather than replaces geography: satellites still need ground stations, hypersonics need launch platforms, cyber attacks need physical infrastructure targets. Technology reduces but doesn't eliminate geographic advantage. Space becoming contested domain like cyberspace. 2025 challenge: maintain strategic stability as AI/hypersonics reduce warning times, increasing miscalculation risks.

**Key Points**:
- Space satellites: ISR, GPS, communications overcome distance - command space = command sea
- Hypersonics: strike anywhere in minutes, compress decision timelines, hard to intercept
- Chinese satellite 'kill web' provides hypersonic targeting capability
- Technology augments geography, doesn't replace: still need ground infrastructure
- 2025: AI + hypersonics reduce warning times, increase miscalculation risk
