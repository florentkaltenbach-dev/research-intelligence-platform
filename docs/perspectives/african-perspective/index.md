## Perspectives by Event

### [China CIPS Expansion to 185+ Countries (176 Direct Participants)](/events/china-cips-expansion-to-185-countries-176-direct-participants)

Most enthusiastic adoption: Afreximbank and Standard Bank joining as direct participants signals continent-wide integration. African analysis emphasizes: (1) Western banks reducing Africa presence creating vacuum, (2) CIPS offering lower transaction costs than correspondent banking (remittances average 8.5% in sub-Saharan Africa - most expensive globally), (3) BRI loans often yuan-denominated making CIPS natural repayment channel. 53 of 54 African nations in BRI with CIPS access.

**Key Points**:
- Afreximbank & Standard Bank first African direct participants
- Lower costs than correspondent banking (8.5% average remittance fees)
- 53 of 54 African countries in BRI
- Western bank retreat created vacuum
- Standard Bank launching CIPS for clients September 2025

### [Africa in Multipolar Order: 30% Critical Minerals & US-China Competition](/events/africa-in-multipolar-order-30-critical-minerals-us-china-competition)

African states increasingly asserting strategic autonomy, playing great powers against each other for better deals. Frustrated with Western conditionality and lectures while China delivers infrastructure. Resource nationalism rising: African states demanding more value capture - processing, refining locally vs exporting raw materials. DRC pushing to process cobalt domestically. BRICS membership (South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia) seen as diversifying options beyond West-dominated institutions. Concerns about Chinese debt, labor practices, but pragmatic about needing investment. Youth bulge offers demographic dividend if jobs created, crisis if not. Climate change disproportionately affecting Africa despite minimal contribution to emissions.

**Key Points**:
- Strategic autonomy: Playing powers against each other
- China delivers infrastructure, West lectures
- Resource nationalism rising: Local processing demanded
- BRICS diversifies options beyond Western institutions
- Chinese debt concerns but need investment
- Youth bulge: Dividend if jobs, crisis if not

### [Islamic Finance Growth to $6 Trillion (Projected $9.7T by 2029)](/events/islamic-finance-growth-to-6-trillion-projected-97t-by-2029)

Growing African interest, particularly Muslim-majority North/West Africa. African sources emphasize ethics-based approach and profit-loss sharing as potentially more equitable than conventional banking. AfDB and African institutions issuing sukuk to tap Gulf liquidity. Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt issued $3.045B combined in 2024. Views as bridge to Gulf capital and alternative to Western institutions reducing Africa exposure, though capacity constraints and regulatory frameworks lag.

**Key Points**:
- Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt: $3.045B sukuk 2024
- Ethics-based approach seen as more equitable
- Bridge to Gulf capital access
- Alternative to Western banks retreating from Africa
- Regulatory and capacity constraints remain
