## Perspectives by Event

### [Geographical Determinism: The Same Strategic Locations for Millennia](/events/geographical-determinism-the-same-strategic-locations-for-millennia)

Iran sits on Strait of Hormuz through which 27% of world's crude oil and 22% of global LNG maritime trade passes - geographic position provides strategic weapon despite decades of sanctions. Iran repeatedly threatened closure (1980s-present) as leverage. However, 2025 reveals limits: Iran's economic survival hinges on access to one buyer (China, 90% of Iran's oil exports ~1.6M barrels/day under sanctions). Trump's 2025 'maximum pressure' targets Iran-China oil trade. June 2025 Israel-US strikes on Iran demonstrated vulnerability: threatening Hormuz closure would alienate China, Iran's economic lifeline. Geographic advantage undermined by economic dependence. Paradox: controls critical chokepoint but cannot weaponize it without self-harm. Geography provides potential power, but economic/political context determines usability.

**Key Points**:
- Hormuz: 27% world crude oil, 22% global LNG maritime trade
- Geographic leverage: repeatedly threatened closure 1980s-present
- Economic constraint: 90% oil exports to China (1.6M bpd), cannot alienate
- Trump 2025 maximum pressure targets Iran-China oil trade
- June 2025: Israel-US strikes demonstrated limits of Hormuz leverage

### [China-Brokered Saudi-Iran Rapprochement: Middle East Realignment](/events/china-brokered-saudi-iran-rapprochement-middle-east-realignment)

Iran viewed rapprochement as diplomatic victory demonstrating sanctions resistance and regional relevance despite US pressure. Maximum Pressure campaign failed to isolate Iran. China's mediation offered legitimacy: major power treating Iran as equal partner, not pariah state. For Iran, agreement was pragmatic: reduce Saudi hostility, ease regional isolation, open economic opportunities via Saudi investment and regional trade. China's role significant: largest oil customer, sanctions-busting economic lifeline, diplomatic counterweight to US. Agreement demonstrated multipolar world emerging where US cannot unilaterally determine regional outcomes. Reduced sectarian competition, enabled focus on domestic economy under sanctions.

**Key Points**:
- Diplomatic victory: sanctions resistance, regional relevance despite US pressure
- China treats Iran as equal partner, not pariah - legitimacy matters
- Pragmatic: reduce Saudi hostility, ease isolation, open economic opportunities
- China largest oil customer, sanctions-busting lifeline, diplomatic counter to US
- Proof multipolar world emerging beyond US unilateral control
