### [Energy Transition Geopolitics: Critical Minerals Competition Intensifies](/events/energy-transition-geopolitics-critical-minerals-competition-intensifies)

West faces critical vulnerability in energy transition: cannot decarbonize without Chinese-controlled supply chains. IEA 2025 Global Critical Minerals Outlook highlights concentration risks. Supply concentrated further 2020-2024 despite diversification rhetoric: top 3 nations' share rose 82% to 86%. 84% of renewable stakeholders report geopolitical delays/cancellations. G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan launched but progress slow: non-Chinese capacity projected only 25-30% by 2027. Tension between climate goals and geopolitical competition. Some argue overemphasis on China reduces Western competitiveness. Reality: achieving supply chain resilience requires sustained decades-long investment, political will questionable.

**Key Points**:
- Cannot achieve net-zero without Chinese supply chains currently
- IEA 2025 warns of concentration: 82% to 86% top-3 share (2020-2024)
- 84% renewables stakeholders report geopolitical project disruptions
- G7 plan: only 25-30% non-Chinese capacity by 2027 (from 10-15%)
- Tension: climate goals require cooperation, geopolitics demands competition
