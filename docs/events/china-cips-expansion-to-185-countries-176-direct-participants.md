## Overview

China Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) reached 176 direct participants and 1,514 indirect participants across 121 countries, with business coverage extending to 189 countries and 4,900+ banking institutions. Processed 175.49 trillion yuan ($24.47T) in 2024 (+42.6% YoY), tripling since 2020. June 2025 marked first direct partnerships with 6 institutions in Africa/Middle East: Afreximbank, Standard Bank (South Africa), First Abu Dhabi Bank, UOB Singapore, Eldik Bank (Kyrgyzstan), and Chongwa Macau.

## Regional Perspectives

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Acknowledges growth (175.49T yuan/$24.45T processed in 2024, +43%) but emphasizes limitations: yuan only 3% of global SWIFT payments vs 48% for dollar. Notes CIPS still relies on SWIFT messaging for many transactions. Presents as regional system lacking global scale compared to SWIFT 11,500+ institutions in 235+ countries.

**Key Points**:
- 175.49T yuan ($24.47T) processed in 2024, +42.6% YoY
- 176 direct participants, 1,514 indirect
- Yuan only 3% of SWIFT payments vs 48% USD
- SWIFT has 11,500+ institutions in 235+ countries
- CIPS still uses SWIFT messaging for many transactions

### Chinese State/Academic Perspective

Testing ground narrative: PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng called Africa partnerships key step in advancing economic ties. Emphasizes yuan stablecoin (AxCNH) in Kazakhstan, Shanghai Oil & Gas Exchange yuan pricing, and 40 bilateral settlement agreements. Views CIPS as parallel infrastructure, not SWIFT replacement - real alternative for global trade settlements operating alongside Western system.

**Key Points**:
- 189 countries business coverage through 4,900+ banks
- June 2025: First Africa/ME direct partnerships (6 institutions)
- Transactions/value tripled since 2020
- CAGR 2022-2024: 35% volume, 30% value
- Parallel infrastructure strategy, not SWIFT replacement

### African Perspective Perspective

Most enthusiastic adoption: Afreximbank and Standard Bank joining as direct participants signals continent-wide integration. African analysis emphasizes: (1) Western banks reducing Africa presence creating vacuum, (2) CIPS offering lower transaction costs than correspondent banking (remittances average 8.5% in sub-Saharan Africa - most expensive globally), (3) BRI loans often yuan-denominated making CIPS natural repayment channel. 53 of 54 African nations in BRI with CIPS access.

**Key Points**:
- Afreximbank & Standard Bank first African direct participants
- Lower costs than correspondent banking (8.5% average remittance fees)
- 53 of 54 African countries in BRI
- Western bank retreat created vacuum
- Standard Bank launching CIPS for clients September 2025
