## Overview

June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague: Allies committed to 5% GDP defense spending by 2035, split as 3.5% core defense + 1.5% infrastructure/cyber/resilience/industrial base. More than doubles from 2% target. Global military spending reached $2.718T in 2024 (+9.4% YoY, steepest rise since 1988), with NATO $1.506T (55% global). European NATO $454B (30% of alliance). Projected impact: If all NATO allies meet 2035 target, need $1.4T more annually than 2024, putting NATO total at $2.9T. Decade of consecutive increases: +37% from 2015-2024. European spending rose from 1.43% GDP (2014) to 2.02% (2024), now targeting 5% by 2035.

## Regional Perspectives

### Western/NATO Perspective Perspective

Framed as necessary response to Russian aggression and Chinese assertiveness. 5% target driven by Trump administration pressure and European recognition that US security guarantee not permanent. Ukraine war proves Europe must defend itself. European leaders emphasize sacrifice necessary - defense vs healthcare/welfare trade-offs explicit. Baltic states, Poland see existential threat from Russia. Western Europe slower to embrace but gradually accepting necessity. Sees decade-long rearmament as reversing post-Cold War 'peace dividend' cuts. Industrial base atrophied during peacetime, must rebuild.

**Key Points**:
- Response to Russian threat and Chinese rise
- Trump pressure + European self-defense recognition
- Ukraine proves Europe must defend itself
- Defense vs welfare explicit trade-offs
- Reversing post-Cold War peace dividend
- Industrial base rebuild necessary

### Russian Perspective Perspective

Views NATO expansion and rearmament as proof of Western hostility. Frames 5% spending as preparation for eventual confrontation with Russia. Argues NATO outspends Russia already ($1.506T vs Russia's lower spending), making claims of defensive nature implausible. Sees Ukraine as proxy war and NATO expansion as existential threat. Notes Europe's economic struggles make 5% unsustainable long-term. Emphasizes Russia's asymmetric advantages: nuclear arsenal, resource self-sufficiency, tested defense industry. Views NATO cohesion as fragile - US-Europe tensions, Turkey's independence, Hungary's resistance show cracks.

**Key Points**:
- NATO expansion + rearmament proves Western hostility
- 5% preparing for confrontation with Russia
- Already massive spending gap: NATO $1.5T vs Russia
- Ukraine = proxy war, expansion = threat
- Europe's 5% economically unsustainable
- Russia has asymmetric advantages: nuclear, resources, industry

### Chinese Perspective Perspective

China notes NATO's Indo-Pacific focus beyond traditional Atlantic area. Sees 5% spending as part of broader US strategy to contain China. Questions NATO's defensive claims given expansion into Asia-Pacific through Japan, South Korea, Australia partnerships. Views massive defense spending as sign of Western economic militarization and declining competitiveness. Argues China's lower defense spending as percentage of GDP (estimated 1.5-2%) shows peaceful intentions. Frames NATO rearmament as diverting resources from economic competition where China excels. Expects European fiscal limits to constrain actual spending.

**Key Points**:
- NATO expanding to Indo-Pacific = China containment
- 5% spending shows Western militarization
- Questions 'defensive' claims given Asia-Pacific expansion
- China 1.5-2% GDP shows peaceful intentions
- Diverts resources from economic competition
- European fiscal reality will constrain spending
