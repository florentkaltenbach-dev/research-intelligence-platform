# China-Brokered Saudi-Iran Rapprochement: Middle East Realignment

**Date**: 2023-03-10
**Region**: Middle East
**Impact Level**: HIGH

## Overview

On March 10, 2023, Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed in Beijing to reestablish diplomatic relations after seven years of severed ties, with China's mediation. Earlier negotiations facilitated by Iraq and Oman (from April 2021) brought parties to table, but China offered hosting for final agreement in December 2022 at first Chinese-Arab summit in Riyadh. Agreement ended seven-year rivalry, reopened embassies within two months. Represents Beijing's first foray into Middle East mediation, area long dominated by Washington. Both countries are major Chinese crude oil sources; China is largest trading partner for both. China's success attributed to 'power of not using power' - leveraging geoeconomic influence without coercion. Dramatically shifted regional balance, reduced sectarian tensions, opened space for Yemen peace talks. Still relevant in 2025 as model for China's Global South mediation approach.

## Regional Perspectives

### American Perspective

US views Saudi-Iran rapprochement with concern as symbol of declining Middle East influence and China's rising diplomatic role. Agreement reached without US involvement in region long considered American sphere. Represents failure of Maximum Pressure on Iran and questions about US reliability as Saudi security partner. However, some analysts argue China's role was modest - mediation by Iraq/Oman (2021-2022) did heavy lifting, China just hosted final signing. Concern: trend of US disengagement (Afghanistan, Syria) creating vacuum China fills not via military but via economic partnerships and neutral mediation. Long-term worry: if China can mediate conflicts, US military presence justification weakens.

**Key Points**: ["Symbol of declining Middle East influence, China's rising diplomatic role", "Agreement without US in region long considered American sphere", "Represents Maximum Pressure failure, questions about US reliability", "Debate: China's role modest (Iraq/Oman did heavy lifting) vs significant", "Trend: US disengagement creates vacuum China fills via economics/diplomacy"]

### Chinese Perspective

China views Saudi-Iran mediation as proof of alternative diplomatic model: economic partnerships enabling honest broker role without military threats or regime change demands. Success based on 'power of not using power' - leveraging geoeconomic influence (largest trade partner for both, major oil imports from both) without coercion. Xi Jinping's December 2022 Riyadh visit for first Chinese-Arab summit created opportunity to offer Beijing hosting. China's approach: respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, focus on mutual economic interests. Demonstrates China can deliver diplomatic results without US military presence. Model for Global South engagement and multipolar order where multiple powers can mediate regional conflicts.

**Key Points**: ["Proof of alternative diplomatic model: economic partnerships enable mediation", "'Power of not using power' - geoeconomic leverage without coercion", "Largest trade partner for both Saudi and Iran, major oil importer", "Non-interference, sovereignty respect, mutual economic interests", "First Middle East mediation demonstrates multipolar diplomacy"]

### Iranian Perspective

Iran viewed rapprochement as diplomatic victory demonstrating sanctions resistance and regional relevance despite US pressure. Maximum Pressure campaign failed to isolate Iran. China's mediation offered legitimacy: major power treating Iran as equal partner, not pariah state. For Iran, agreement was pragmatic: reduce Saudi hostility, ease regional isolation, open economic opportunities via Saudi investment and regional trade. China's role significant: largest oil customer, sanctions-busting economic lifeline, diplomatic counterweight to US. Agreement demonstrated multipolar world emerging where US cannot unilaterally determine regional outcomes. Reduced sectarian competition, enabled focus on domestic economy under sanctions.

**Key Points**: ["Diplomatic victory: sanctions resistance, regional relevance despite US pressure", "China treats Iran as equal partner, not pariah - legitimacy matters", "Pragmatic: reduce Saudi hostility, ease isolation, open economic opportunities", "China largest oil customer, sanctions-busting lifeline, diplomatic counter to US", "Proof multipolar world emerging beyond US unilateral control"]

### Regional/Middle East Perspective

Regional states view rapprochement positively as reducing sectarian tensions and conflict risk. Yemen particularly benefited: Saudi-Iran de-escalation opened space for peace negotiations. Iraq and Oman see vindication: their 2021-2022 mediation laid groundwork despite China getting credit for final agreement. UAE, which had already normalized Israel relations and engaged Iran pragmatically, sees trend toward economic pragmatism over ideological confrontation. Regional smaller states welcome reduced Saudi-Iran rivalry - forced to take sides in proxy conflicts from Syria to Yemen. Hope: great power competition (US vs China) creates space for regional autonomy as both compete for partnerships rather than imposing alignment.

**Key Points**: ["Reduced sectarian tensions, conflict risk across region", "Yemen benefited: Saudi-Iran de-escalation enabled peace negotiations", "Iraq/Oman vindicated: their 2021-2022 mediation laid groundwork", "Trend toward economic pragmatism over ideological confrontation", "Smaller states welcome reduced rivalry, hope for autonomous space"]

### Saudi Arabian Perspective

Saudi Arabia pragmatically pursued rapprochement to reduce regional tensions and focus on Vision 2030 economic transformation. Seven-year rivalry with Iran consumed resources and attention. MBS recognized need for regional stability to attract investment. China's offer to host provided face-saving mechanism - neutral venue, economic partner with interests in both sides. Saudi calculation: US increasingly unreliable (Trump's abandonment concerns, Biden's human rights pressure), China offers stable partnership without political conditions. Rapprochement enabled by Saudi confidence from military modernization and regional position. Risk management: hedge against US withdrawal by improving relations with Iran while maintaining US security ties. Opened space for Yemen de-escalation.

**Key Points**: ["Regional stability needed for Vision 2030 economic transformation", "Seven-year rivalry consumed resources, reduced investment attractiveness", "China neutral venue, face-saving mechanism, stable partner", "US increasingly unreliable: Trump abandonment fears, Biden rights pressure", "Hedging strategy: improve Iran relations while maintaining US security ties"]
