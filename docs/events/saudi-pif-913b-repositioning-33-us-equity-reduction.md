## Regional Perspectives

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Western media frames PIF actions as portfolio rebalancing toward domestic Vision 2030 projects, emphasizing mixed investment outcomes and major losses in Lucid Motors (-55% from peak). Presents $2B Q2 2025 US stock reduction as normal portfolio management with focus on losses rather than strategic repositioning.

**Key Points**:
- PIF reduced US exposure from $25.5B to $23.8B in Q2 2025
- Lucid Motors investment shows $13B accumulated losses, stock down 95%
- Total US holdings down 24% YoY to $26.71B (end 2024)
- 55% decline from $60B peak in 2021
- Emphasis on investment failures rather than geopolitical strategy

### Chinese State/Academic Perspective

Chinese sources interpret as strategic pivot toward China-Gulf economic corridor. Highlight PIF $50B agreements with 6 major Chinese banks (August 2024), Hong Kong office opening (February 2022), and QFII certification pursuit as evidence of systematic reorientation toward Asian markets. Framed as win-win cooperation under BRI framework.

**Key Points**:
- $50B agreements with 6 Chinese banks (August 2024)
- Hong Kong office opened February 2022
- QFII certification pursuit for A-shares access
- Framework represents 1.5x China 2023 total FDI
- Positioned as Belt and Road Initiative cooperation
