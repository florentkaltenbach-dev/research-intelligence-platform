# BRICS Payment Systems: Fragmentation NOT Unity

**Event Type**: Payment Infrastructure Development
**Date Range**: 2021 - 2025
**Confidence Level**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - High confidence with explicit contradictions noted)

---

## Executive Summary

Western media portrays "BRICS de-dollarization" as coordinated strategy. Reality: **Competing national systems** (CIPS, SPFS, India's SRVA) pursuing separate strategies with NO unified payment system operational. BRICS Pay prototype delayed to 2030, while India explicitly rejects de-dollarization agenda.

**Critical Finding**: "90% intra-BRICS local currency trade" claim is **primarily China-Russia bilateral** (95% of $245B), NOT pan-BRICS pattern. India, Brazil pursuing different strategies.

---

## Verified Facts

### Russia-China Bilateral Success
- **China-Russia Trade**: $245B annually
- **Local Currency Settlement**: **95% in yuan/rubles** (up from 25% in 2021)
- **Timeline**: Achieved over 3 years (2021-2024)
- **Driver**: Western sanctions forcing Russia to yuan-based trade

**This is ONE bilateral relationship**, not BRICS-wide pattern.

### India's Explicit Rejection
**December 2024** - India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar:
- **"India has never been for de-dollarization"**
- **"No proposal for BRICS currency"**

**Source**: Republic World, Indian Ministry of External Affairs

**Significance**: The "I" in BRICS officially rejects the "BRICS de-dollarization" narrative.

### BRICS Pay Status
- **October 2024**: Prototype demonstrated at BRICS summit
- **Implementation**: **Delayed to 2030**
- **Current Status**: No operational system
- **Participation**: No commitments from India or Brazil

### Competing National Systems

#### Russia's SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages)
- **Participants**: 550 organizations
- **Foreign Participants**: 150 from 16-20 countries
- **Function**: SWIFT alternative for Russia post-sanctions
- **Limitation**: Primarily Russia-centric, not BRICS-wide

#### China's CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System)
- **Coverage**: 189 countries, 4,900+ institutions
- **Volume**: 175.49T yuan ($24.47T) in 2024
- **Function**: Yuan internationalization, not BRICS-specific
- **See**: [Detailed CIPS analysis](/events/china-cips-expansion)

#### India's SRVA (Special Rupee Vostro Accounts)
- **Function**: Bilateral rupee trade mechanisms
- **Strategy**: Multi-currency approach, NOT de-dollarization
- **Partner Countries**: Russia, UAE, select others for specific commodities

**Pattern**: Three SEPARATE systems, NOT unified BRICS infrastructure.

## Regional Perspectives

### Russian View
**Source**: Interfax, Russian Ministry of Finance

- **Framing**: "BRICS cooperation on payment alternatives"
- **Emphasis**: Russia-China success as model
- **Narrative**: "Building sanction-resistant payment infrastructure"

**What they claim**: Putin's "90% intra-BRICS local currency trade"
**Reality**: Primarily Russia-China bilateral, NOT broader BRICS pattern

### Chinese View
**Source**: CIPS Official, Global Times

- **Framing**: CIPS as global infrastructure, not BRICS-exclusive
- **Emphasis**: 185+ countries participating, not just BRICS
- **Narrative**: "Yuan internationalization through market mechanisms"

**Notably absent**: No claims of "BRICS payment system" - China promoting CIPS globally.

### Indian View
**Source**: Republic World, Indian Ministry of External Affairs, GIS Reports

- **Framing**: Multi-alignment, not de-dollarization
- **Emphasis**: India maintaining dollar, euro, AND rupee payment options
- **Narrative**: "Strategic autonomy means multiple options, not anti-dollar stance"

**Direct Quote (Jaishankar)**: "India has never been for de-dollarization" (Dec 2024)

**Significance**: **Explicit rejection of BRICS de-dollarization narrative** by major member state.

### Western View
**Source**: Al Jazeera, Financial Times, Bloomberg

- **Framing**: "BRICS challenging dollar hegemony"
- **Emphasis**: Threat narrative to Western financial system
- **What's missing**: India's explicit rejection, fragmented national systems

**False Unity Narrative**: Western media portrays BRICS as coordinated bloc when reality is competing national strategies.

## Historical Parallels

### Mongol Empire Fragmentation (Post-1260)
**Relevance**: 0.88

Pattern: **Succession crisis leading to competing khanates**. Post-Möngke, Mongol Empire fractured into Yuan (China), Golden Horde (Russia), Ilkhanate (Persia), Chagatai. All claimed legitimacy under "Mongol" banner while pursuing separate strategies.

**Modern Parallel**: BRICS members claim shared "de-dollarization" banner while:
- China builds CIPS globally (189 countries)
- Russia focuses on sanction circumvention (SPFS)
- India explicitly rejects de-dollarization (dollar + options)
- Brazil pursues regional integration (Mercosur)

**Competing claims under common banner without unified strategy.**

### Warsaw Pact (1955-1991)
**Relevance**: 0.72

Pattern: Formal alliance masking divergent interests. Romania, Poland, Hungary pursued separate strategies while nominally aligned. BRICS similar: Formal declarations masking competing national agendas.

## Data & Metrics

### China-Russia Yuan/Ruble Settlement

| Year | % Yuan/Ruble | % Dollar/Euro | Trade Volume |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 2021 | 25% | 75% | ~$140B |
| 2022 | 65% | 35% | ~$190B |
| 2023 | 85% | 15% | ~$220B |
| 2024 | 95% | 5% | $245B |

**This is bilateral China-Russia**, not BRICS-wide pattern.

### BRICS Pay Implementation Timeline

| Milestone | Original Target | Actual Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Concept | 2019 | Discussed |
| Prototype | 2024 | Demonstrated Oct 2024 |
| Implementation | 2025 | **Delayed to 2030** |
| Adoption | 2026 | No commitments |

### Payment System Coverage

| System | Countries | Institutions | 2024 Volume |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **SWIFT** | 200+ | 11,000+ | $5-7 trillion/day |
| **CIPS** (China) | 189 | 4,900+ | $24.47T (annual) |
| **SPFS** (Russia) | 16-20 (foreign) | 550 (total) | Undisclosed |
| **BRICS Pay** | 0 (operational) | 0 | $0 |

**SWIFT remains dominant by 100x+ volume over CIPS.**

## Analysis: What This Reveals

### 1. False Unity Narrative
"BRICS de-dollarization" is **Western construct**, not BRICS self-description. Members pursuing divergent strategies:
- **China**: Global yuan internationalization
- **Russia**: Sanction circumvention
- **India**: Multi-currency optionality (explicitly NOT de-dollarization)
- **Brazil**: Regional integration
- **South Africa**: Minimal participation

### 2. Bilateral Success ≠ Multilateral Pattern
China-Russia 95% yuan/ruble settlement is **unique bilateral relationship** driven by Western sanctions forcing Russia to accept yuan. Not replicable across BRICS.

India-China trade? Still predominantly dollar-settled.
Brazil-China trade? Primarily dollar-settled with yuan options.

### 3. Infrastructure Over Ideology
Successful alternatives (CIPS) are pragmatic infrastructure projects open to ALL countries (189 participating), not ideological anti-dollar coalitions.

BRICS Pay (ideological project) delayed to 2030 with zero commitments.

### 4. Optionality, Not Replacement
India's position most revealing: **Not anti-dollar, pro-options**. This is shared BRICS interest:
- Access to BOTH dollar system AND alternatives
- UAE/Singapore model: Offering access to ALL systems = success

### 5. Western Analysis Creates Threat It Fears
By portraying BRICS as unified alternative, Western media:
- Overstates BRICS coordination (helps BRICS appear more powerful)
- Understates fragmentation (misses strategic opportunities to engage India, Brazil separately)
- Creates self-fulfilling prophecy (harsh sanctions push Russia/China closer)

## Counter-Narrative: What If BRICS Is Just... A Conference?

**Contrarian Take**: BRICS may be more similar to G20 (diverse forum) than EU (integrated bloc). Members share:
- Opposition to dollar MONOPOLY (not dollar itself)
- Desire for MORE options (not dollar replacement)
- Resistance to Western sanctions weaponization

But DO NOT share:
- ❌ Unified payment system (3+ competing systems)
- ❌ Common currency vision (India explicitly rejects)
- ❌ Coordinated de-dollarization strategy (China global, Russia circumvention, India multi-currency)

**BRICS as forum for coordination on specific issues ≠ BRICS as anti-dollar alliance.**

## Future Monitoring

**Next Research Priorities:**
1. Track BRICS Pay progress toward 2030 target (or further delays)
2. Monitor India-Russia trade settlement patterns (rupee vs dollar)
3. Watch for Brazil's payment system developments
4. Assess whether new BRICS members (UAE, Egypt) join payment initiatives
5. Compare rhetoric vs reality: BRICS summit declarations vs actual bilateral trade patterns

**Key Question**: Can BRICS coordinate on payment systems when India explicitly rejects de-dollarization? Or will this remain competing national strategies under shared banner?
