Singapore expects 1,600 (down from 3,500 in 2024) due to raised Global Investor Programme (S$10M from S$2.5M) and high property prices. USA 7,500 inflow. UK sees largest outflow: -16,500 (double China -7,800). Dubai hosts 120 family offices managing $1.2T.

## Regional Perspectives

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Frames as wealth migration driven by personal tax optimization, political stability, business opportunities.

Acknowledges geopolitical instability factor but emphasizes personal financial motivations over systemic shifts.

**Key Points**:
- 142,000 HNWIs relocating in 2025 (record high)
- Tax optimization primary driver in Western framing
- UK losing -16,500 (largest outflow)
- High-tax jurisdictions losing to zero-tax havens
- Individual rational choice over systemic interpretation

### Middle Eastern View - UAE TRIUMPHALIST Perspective

UAE sources present as validation of diversification from oil economy. Dubai positioning as Switzerland of Middle East with strong rule of law, asset protection. Dubai International Financial Centre hosts 120 family offices managing $1.2T. Emphasizes emergence as alternative to London/New York/Hong Kong with optionality (access to both Western and non-Western systems).

**Key Points**:

### Russian Perspective Perspective

Russian oligarchs among those relocating to UAE/Dubai after sanctions. Russian analysis presents as adaptation to financial warfare - moving assets to jurisdictions less susceptible to Western sanctions. UAE refusal to sanction Russia makes it attractive safe haven.

Real estate doubled to $500M H1 2022, 96.4t gold imported, hundreds of Russian companies created.

**Key Points**:
- UAE did not impose Russia sanctions
- Russian real estate in Dubai doubled to $500M (H1 2022)
- 96.4 tonnes gold imported from Russia (2022)
- Hundreds of Russian companies created since Feb 2022
- UAE on FATF grey list 2022-2024 for money laundering
