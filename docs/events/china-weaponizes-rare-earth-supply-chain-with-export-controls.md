# China Weaponizes Rare Earth Supply Chain with Export Controls

**Date**: 2025-04-04
**Region**: Global
**Impact Level**: critical

---

## Overview

China escalated use of rare earths as geopolitical tool through multiple 2025 export restrictions. April 4, 2025: restricted 7 rare earth elements in retaliation for Trump tariffs. October 2025: expanded controls targeting downstream applications in semiconductors/AI with military potential. First use of foreign direct product rule (FDPR) by China, mirroring US tactics. December 1, 2025: companies with foreign military affiliations largely denied export licenses. China controls 70% of global rare earth mining, 90%+ refining capacity, 92% of NdFeB magnets. Critical for F-35s, Virginia-class submarines, Tomahawks, EVs, wind turbines.

## Regional Perspectives

### Chinese Perspective

China views rare earth controls as legitimate response to US weaponization of semiconductors and CHIPS Act restrictions. April 2025 restrictions on 7 heavy rare earths (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium) were direct retaliation for Trump's new tariffs. October 2025 expansion targets military applications, applying foreign direct product rule for first time. China emphasizes this mirrors US tactics. Controls affect gallium (95% from China), germanium, antimony, tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, molybdenum. Seen as leveraging China's natural resource advantage in technology competition.

**Key Points**:
- Rare earth controls legitimate response to US semiconductor weaponization
- China produces 70% of rare earth mining, 90%+ refining, 92% of NdFeB magnets
- First Chinese use of FDPR mirrors US tactics
- December 1, 2025: foreign military-affiliated companies denied licenses
- Gallium (95% Chinese), germanium, antimony restricted to US

### American/Western Perspective

US views China's rare earth restrictions as strategic threat to defense supply chains and clean energy transition. F-35s, submarines, Tomahawks, radar systems, UAVs depend on rare earths. European Commission President von der Leyen accused China of 'weaponizing' control over critical materials. G7 launched Critical Minerals Action Plan. US countermeasures: $400M DoD equity investment in MP Materials (largest shareholder), 10-year price floor of $110/kg for NdPr products. However, achieving supply chain resilience requires sustained long-term investment. Non-Chinese separation capacity projected to reach only 25-30% by 2027.

**Key Points**:
- Critical threat to defense: F-35, Virginia/Columbia submarines, Tomahawks
- Von der Leyen: China 'weaponizing' critical materials
- DoD $400M investment in MP Materials, now largest shareholder
- G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan launched
- Non-Chinese capacity: 25-30% by 2027, still far from self-sufficiency

### European Perspective

EU deeply concerned about rare earth dependence for green transition and defense. 84% of renewable energy stakeholders say geopolitical challenges causing substantial delays or abandonment of projects. China controls supply chains for solar panels, battery components, critical minerals. Rare earths fundamental to wind turbines, EV motors, defense tech. EU caught between US-China competition, seeking supply diversification but facing concentration trends: average market share of top 3 refining nations rose from 82% (2020) to 86% (2024). Von der Leyen calls for united G7 response to weaponization.

**Key Points**:
- 84% of renewables stakeholders report geopolitical delays/cancellations
- Rare earths critical for wind turbines, EV motors, solar infrastructure
- Supply concentration increased 2020-2024 despite diversification efforts
- EU caught between US-China tech competition
- Green transition threatened by China's supply chain dominance
