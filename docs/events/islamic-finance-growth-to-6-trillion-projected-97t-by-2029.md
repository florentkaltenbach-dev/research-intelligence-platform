## Regional Perspectives

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Generally overlooked or minimized in mainstream Western coverage despite $6T scale (larger than many G20 economies). When covered, presents as niche market or specialty finance. Acknowledges sukuk growth (+25.6% to $230.4B in 2024) but rarely contextualizes as parallel financial architecture operating at scale. Tends to emphasize exotic Shariah compliance requirements as barriers rather than features.

**Key Points**:
- $6T scale rarely contextualized in Western media
- Treated as niche despite exceeding many G20 economies
- Sukuk growth acknowledged but not systemic significance
- Shariah compliance framed as exotic/complex
- Parallel financial architecture aspect ignored

### Middle Eastern View - PRIMARY NARRATIVE Perspective

GCC holds 50% of global Islamic finance assets ($2.5-2.7T in 2024, projected $5T+ by 2029). Middle Eastern sources present not as alternative but as authentic system aligned with civilizational values. Saudi Vision 2030 and UAE strategies explicitly prioritize Islamic finance development. Recent: PIF second sukuk, Mubadala debut sukuk (March 2024), green sukuk $4B Q1 2024 (+17% YoY). Frames as moral capitalism surpassing Western system ethical failures (2008 financial crisis).

**Key Points**:
- GCC holds ~50% of $6T global assets
- Projected $9.7T by 2029 (10% CAGR)
- Iran $2.24T, Saudi $1.31T, Malaysia $761B = 72% global
- Sukuk market >$1T outstanding, $250B issuance 2024
- UAE targeting AED 2.56T banking assets by 2031

### African Perspective Perspective

Growing African interest, particularly Muslim-majority North/West Africa. African sources emphasize ethics-based approach and profit-loss sharing as potentially more equitable than conventional banking. AfDB and African institutions issuing sukuk to tap Gulf liquidity. Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt issued $3.045B combined in 2024. Views as bridge to Gulf capital and alternative to Western institutions reducing Africa exposure, though capacity constraints and regulatory frameworks lag.

**Key Points**:
- Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt: $3.045B sukuk 2024
- Ethics-based approach seen as more equitable
- Bridge to Gulf capital access
- Alternative to Western banks retreating from Africa
- Regulatory and capacity constraints remain
