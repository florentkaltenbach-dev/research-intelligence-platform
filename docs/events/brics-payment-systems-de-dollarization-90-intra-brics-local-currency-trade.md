# BRICS Payment Systems & De-Dollarization: 90% Intra-BRICS Local Currency Trade

**Date**: 2024-10-23
**Region**: Global/BRICS
**Impact Level**: high

---

## Overview

Russia reported 90% of intra-BRICS trade now settled in local currencies (up from 65% two years prior), with China-Russia bilateral trade reaching 95% yuan/ruble settlement on $245B volume (2024 record). However, no unified BRICS Pay system exists - prototype demonstrated October 2024 but implementation delayed to 2030. Russia SPFS system has 550 organizations (150 from 16 countries), while China CIPS processed 175T yuan in 2024. Critically, India Foreign Minister Jaishankar explicitly stated India has never been for de-dollarization and no proposal for BRICS currency, pursuing separate rupee internationalization via RBI SRVA system. Reality: competing national systems (CIPS, SPFS, SRVA) with coordination of convenience, not integration.

## Regional Perspectives

### Chinese State/Academic Perspective

Incrementalist success narrative: emphasizes 95% of China-Russia trade now in yuan/rubles, CIPS processing 52T yuan ($7.2T) annually - 58% of China cross-border transactions. Frames BRICS Pay delays as pragmatic approach favoring bilateral systems over premature multilateral launch. Views Western skepticism as defensive reaction to losing financial infrastructure monopoly. CIPS growth (+42.6% in 2024) demonstrates systematic progress.

**Key Points**:
- 95% of China-Russia trade ($245B) in yuan/rubles
- CIPS processed 175T yuan ($24.47T) in 2024, +42.6% YoY
- 176 direct participants, 1,514 indirect, 189 countries coverage
- Bilateral systems preferred over premature multilateral
- Systematic infrastructure building vs rhetoric

---

### Russian Perspective Perspective

SPFS now connects 550+ organizations including 150 from 16 foreign countries (expanded to 20 by Jan 2024). Russian analysis presents as successful sanctions circumvention - financial isolation transformed into opportunity for alternative system building. Views 90% local currency settlement as validation of strategy. Emphasizes BRICS expansion (now 47.9% of global population) as historic shift. Critical of Indian hesitation but pragmatic about separate national approaches.

**Key Points**:
- SPFS: 550 organizations, 150 non-residents from 16-20 countries
- 90% intra-BRICS local currency settlement (Putin statement)
- 95% China-Russia bilateral trade in yuan/rubles
- Sanctions circumvention successful
- EU banned SPFS June 2024, US OFAC warned institutions Nov 2024

### Indian Interpretation - CRITICAL DIVERGENCE Perspective

MOST AMBIVALENT NARRATIVE and directly contradicts BRICS unity framing. Foreign Minister Jaishankar (December 2024): India has never been for de-dollarization and no proposal for BRICS currency. India pursuing bilateral rupee internationalization via RBI SRVA (Special Rupee Vostro Account) expansion instead of multilateral BRICS system. Views unified system as potential Chinese dominance; prefers Indian-controlled alternatives. US is India largest trade partner with no interest in weakening dollar.

**Key Points**:
- Jaishankar: India has never been for de-dollarization
- No proposal for BRICS currency - explicit rejection
- RBI SRVA expansion for bilateral rupee settlements
- US is India largest trade partner
- Fears Chinese dominance in unified BRICS system

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Skeptical framing: BRICS Pay not operational despite speculation, emphasizes 2030 target as unrealistic, questions feasibility given member rivalries. Notes dollar still commands 58% of global reserves. Treats as aspirational rhetoric with limited practical impact, emphasizing technical challenges and political divisions among BRICS members.

**Key Points**:
- BRICS Pay prototype shown October 2024 but not operational
- Implementation now targeted for 2030 (delayed)
- Dollar still 58% of global reserves
- Emphasizes member rivalries (India-China tensions)
- Technical challenges and coordination issues highlighted
