# India's Strategic Autonomy: Multi-Alignment Between Quad, Russia, and China

**Date**: 2024-10-01
**Region**: India/Global
**Impact Level**: high

---

## Overview

India maintains strategic autonomy through multi-alignment policy, participating in Quad with US/Japan/Australia while importing 36% of weapons from Russia (down from 55% in 2015-19) and maintaining $140B trade with China despite 2020 Galwan clash. Took delivery of 3 Russian S-400 systems in 2023, expects 2 more by 2025. Refused to condemn Russia-Ukraine war despite Quad pressure. October 2024 border agreement with China shows functional relations with rivals. Strategic autonomy faces strain as US-China decoupling intensifies, with both being India's largest trading partners.

## Regional Perspectives

### Western/US Perspective Perspective

US views India as vital to counter China's rise in Indo-Pacific, making India cornerstone of Quad strategy. Frustrated by India's refusal to condemn Russia over Ukraine and continued arms imports. Recognizes India needs 'strategic autonomy' but pushes for closer alignment. Sees India as future great power that could balance China if properly aligned. Concerned about India-China rapprochement undermining containment strategy. US defense cooperation with India growing but Russia remains 36% of India's weapons imports.

**Key Points**:
- India vital to Indo-Pacific strategy and Quad
- Frustrated by India neutrality on Russia-Ukraine
- US-India defense cooperation growing
- Concerns about India-China border agreement Oct 2024
- India strategic autonomy complicates US alliance structure

### Indian Perspective Perspective

India frames strategic autonomy as core principle of post-Cold War foreign policy. Refuses binding alliances, instead maintains flexible partnerships across rivals. Views Quad as security cooperation, not military alliance. Russia relationship valued for defense technology transfer and energy (35-40% crude imports). China relationship managed pragmatically despite border tensions - $140B trade and Oct 2024 agreement shows functional ties. India positioning as leader of Global South, bridging East-West divide. Sees multi-alignment as maximizing options in multipolar world.

**Key Points**:
- Strategic autonomy = core foreign policy principle
- Multi-alignment maximizes options in multipolar world

- Russia valued for defense tech and energy
- China tensions managed, trade functional
- Positioning as Global South leader

### Russian Perspective Perspective

Russia views India as critical partner for evading Western sanctions. India-Russia trade reached $66B, largely settled in local currencies. Energy exports to India offset Western market losses. Defense relationship remains strong despite India diversifying suppliers (36% from Russia vs 55% previously). Concerned about India's Quad participation and growing US ties, but pragmatic about India's multi-alignment. Sees India as proof that non-Western powers can resist US pressure. Views India-Russia-China triangle as ideal but accepts India-China tensions limit full alignment.

**Key Points**:
- India critical for sanctions evasion, $66B trade
- Energy exports to India offset Western losses
- Defense relationship strong but declining share
- Accepts India's multi-alignment pragmatically
- India proves non-Western can resist US pressure
- Ideal: Russia-India-China triangle, reality: complications

### Chinese Perspective Perspective

China sees India as both partner and rival. Trade at $140B makes India major economic partner despite border tensions. October 2024 border agreement shows both sides prefer functional relations. Concerned about India's Quad participation as containment effort. Views India's strategic autonomy as preventing full US alignment, which benefits China. Recognizes India as emerging competitor for Global South leadership. Long-term: China expects India to be major power center in multipolar world, prefers managed competition to confrontation.

**Key Points**:
- $140B trade despite border tensions
- Oct 2024 agreement shows preference for functional relations
- Quad concerns but India autonomy prevents full US alignment
- Competition for Global South leadership
- Long-term: India emerging power center
- Prefer managed competition to confrontation
