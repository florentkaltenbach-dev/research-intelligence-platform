# China's CIPS Expansion to 185+ Countries

**Event Type**: Payment Infrastructure Expansion
**Date Range**: 2015 - 2025
**Confidence Level**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 - Very high confidence, official system data)

---

## Executive Summary

China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) now reaches 189 countries with 4,900+ banking institutions, processing 175.49T yuan ($24.47T) in 2024 (+42.6% YoY). **However**, yuan remains only 3% of global SWIFT payments vs 48% USD, revealing gap between infrastructure development and actual adoption.

**Key Insight**: Infrastructure built FIRST, adoption follows gradually. CIPS expansion is decade-long project, not immediate dollar replacement.

## Regional Perspectives

### Chinese View
**Source**: CIPS Official, South China Morning Post, Global Times

- **Framing**: "Global public good" for yuan internationalization
- **Emphasis**: 189 countries as proof of market demand
- **Narrative**: "Patient infrastructure development over decades"

**Quote**: "CIPS provides efficient yuan settlement infrastructure for countries worldwide seeking diversified payment options."

**What they emphasize**: Growing participation
**What they don't emphasize**: 3% SWIFT share

### African View
**Source**: NTU-SBF Centre for African Studies, Afreximbank

- **Framing**: Alternative to dollar dependency for China trade
- **Emphasis**: Africa-China trade ($250B+) now settleable in yuan
- **Narrative**: "Reducing currency conversion costs and exchange rate risk"

**Practical motivation**:
- Africa-China trade = $250B+ annually
- Previously required dollar conversion (fees + exchange rate risk)
- Yuan settlement = direct, lower cost

### Middle Eastern View
**Source**: First Abu Dhabi Bank, Gulf News

- **Framing**: Diversification option alongside dollar
- **Emphasis**: UAE as bridge between East and West
- **Narrative**: "Access to ALL payment systems = competitive advantage"

**UAE Strategy**: Join CIPS, maintain SWIFT, participate in BRICS discussions = maximum optionality.

### Western View
**Source**: FXC Intelligence, Fintech Times, Bloomberg

- **Framing**: "China's challenge to SWIFT dominance"
- **Emphasis**: Geopolitical threat narrative
- **Missing**: Actual adoption data showing limited displacement (3% vs 48%)

**Overstatement**: Western media portrays CIPS as imminent SWIFT replacement when reality is gradual infrastructure buildup with slow adoption.

## Historical Parallels

### British-American Financial Transition (1914-1944)
**Relevance**: 0.92

Pattern: **Infrastructure precedes dominance**. US built Federal Reserve (1913), dollar infrastructure BEFORE Bretton Woods (1944). **30-year gap** between infrastructure and global adoption.

CIPS launched 2015, major expansion 2020-2025. If following similar pattern, yuan prominence unlikely until **2035-2045**.

### Mongol Postal System (Yam)
**Relevance**: 0.75

Pattern: Infrastructure enables control. Mongols built yam (postal/relay system) across Eurasia BEFORE administrative integration. Communication infrastructure preceded political dominance.

CIPS = modern equivalent. Payment infrastructure precedes currency dominance.

## Data & Metrics

### CIPS Growth Trajectory

| Year | Countries | Institutions | Volume (Yuan) | YoY Growth |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| 2020 | ~100 | ~1,000 | ~58T | - |
| 2021 | ~120 | ~1,300 | ~80T | +38% |
| 2022 | ~140 | ~2,000 | ~100T | +25% |
| 2023 | ~170 | ~3,500 | ~123T | +23% |
| 2024 | 189 | 4,900+ | 175.49T | +42.6% |

**Pattern**: Accelerating in participants AND volume.

### SWIFT vs CIPS (Payment Share)

| Currency | % SWIFT Payments (June 2025) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| USD | 48% |
| EUR | 22% |
| GBP | 7% |
| JPY | 4% |
| **CNY (Yuan)** | **3%** |
| Other | 16% |

**Reality**: Despite 189-country CIPS infrastructure, yuan is **5th in SWIFT payments**, 16x behind USD.

## Analysis: What This Reveals

### 1. Infrastructure ≠ Immediate Adoption
CIPS reaches 189 countries, but yuan only 3% of payments. Pattern: **Build infrastructure first, adoption follows over decades.**

Similar to:
- US Federal Reserve 1913 → Bretton Woods 1944 (31 years)
- Euro infrastructure 1999 → ECB full operations 2008 (9 years)

CIPS 2015 → Yuan prominence 2035-2045? (20-30 year timeline)

### 2. Africa/Middle East = Strategic Priorities
June 2025 direct participants (Afreximbank, Standard Bank, FAB) reveal Chinese focus:
- **Africa**: $250B+ annual trade
- **Middle East**: Oil settlements, BRI financing

These regions have PRACTICAL incentives (reduce dollar conversion costs), not just geopolitical alignment.

### 3. Optionality Model Working
FAB (First Abu Dhabi Bank) joining CIPS while maintaining SWIFT dominance demonstrates:
- Countries/banks want ACCESS to multiple systems
- CIPS as OPTION, not replacement
- Multi-system participation = competitive advantage

### 4. Volume Growth Exceeds Payment Share Growth
CIPS volume +42.6% (2024) while yuan SWIFT share stuck at 3% suggests:
- **Growing use among existing users** (China trade partners)
- **Not displacing dollar in NEW use cases**

Pattern: Deepening in specific corridors (China-Africa, China-ME), not broadening globally.

### 5. Western Overreaction Creates Chinese Win
By portraying CIPS as imminent threat, Western media:
- Gives China more credit than deserved (3% share portrayed as major challenge)
- Encourages countries to join CIPS (threat narrative makes it seem inevitable)
- Misses actual timeline (30+ years for infrastructure → dominance)

China benefits from exaggerated threat assessment.

- [BRICS Payment Systems](/events/brics-payment-systems) - Competing/complementary systems
- China-Russia yuan trade - Major CIPS use case (95% of $245B bilateral trade)
- Africa-China trade - Practical driver of adoption ($250B+ trade volume)

## Future Monitoring

**Next Research Priorities:**
1. Track yuan SWIFT payment share - moving beyond 3%?
2. Monitor CIPS direct participant growth in Latin America (next frontier?)
3. Assess correlation between BRI projects and CIPS adoption
4. Compare CIPS volume growth to yuan payment share growth (deepening vs broadening)
5. Watch for Western banks joining CIPS (would signal major shift)

**Key Questions**:
- Will CIPS follow US Fed 1913→1944 timeline (30+ years)?
- Can yuan payment share grow to 10%+ without major economic crisis?
- Does infrastructure development guarantee eventual adoption?
