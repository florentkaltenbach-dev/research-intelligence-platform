**Region**: United States
**Impact Level**: high

---

## Overview

February 2025: Trump announced US sovereign wealth fund, taking 'bottom-up, ad hoc, industrial strategy-driven' approach. CHIPS Act equity-for-grants: US received 10% stake in Intel (Aug 2025, $8.9B awards). Pentagon invested $400M in MP Materials (rare earths), becoming largest shareholder with potential 15% stake - only US rare earth producer. TikTok deal includes US 'golden shares' for veto power. Strategic Bitcoin reserve created March 2025: $5B+ seized BTC (~200,000 coins). Foreign funding component: Japan's $550B investment package tied to tariff deal. White House: 'Government's stake in Intel part of broader SWF strategy for more companies.' Marks shift to state capitalism even in traditional free-market economy.

## Regional Perspectives

### US Domestic Perspective Perspective

Mixed reactions across political spectrum. Industrial policy advocates see validation of state role in strategic sectors. Free-market conservatives uncomfortable with government equity stakes but accept national security justification. CHIPS Act positioned as response to China's state capitalism - 'if they do it, we must.' Intel stake framed as protecting vital semiconductor capacity. MP Materials investment seen as breaking Chinese rare earth monopoly. Tech industry divided: Some welcome state backing, others fear government control. Bitcoin reserve criticized by fiscal conservatives, praised by crypto advocates. Overall: Pragmatic acceptance that market alone insufficient for strategic competition.

**Key Points**:
- Industrial policy advocates validated
- Free-market discomfort but national security accepts
- Response to China state capitalism
- Intel stake protects semiconductor capacity
- MP Materials breaks Chinese rare earth monopoly
- Pragmatic shift: market alone insufficient

### Chinese Perspective Perspective

Frames as vindication of China's state-led development model. US adopting Chinese approach after decades of criticizing it proves state capitalism superiority. Sees hypocrisy in US maintaining 'free market' rhetoric while implementing dirigisme. Views Intel stake as admission that market failed to compete with Chinese industrial policy. Notes US starting from weaker position - China's state capacity more developed. Expects US political system to constrain effectiveness compared to China's coordinated approach. Sees opportunity: While US debates, China executes. Long-term: Validates multipolar model where each system competes on results, not ideology.

**Key Points**:
- Vindication of China state-led model
- US adopting Chinese approach after criticizing it
- Proves state capitalism superiority
- Intel stake = market failed vs Chinese policy
- US state capacity weaker, politics constrain
- China executes while US debates

### European Perspective Perspective

Europe recognizes own version of state capitalism (Airbus model) vindicated. US shift reduces pressure on European industrial policy. Sees US-China convergence on state role while Europe maintains hybrid model. Concerned about being squeezed between US and Chinese state champions. Intel case shows US now competitor for European semiconductor ambitions (ASML dependence remains). MP Materials investment threatens European rare earth strategies. Views US approach as improvised vs Europe's institutional frameworks (EIB, national development banks). Questions US sustainability - political cycles may reverse policy. Europe's patient capital model may prove more durable.

**Key Points**:
- European state capitalism (Airbus) vindicated
- US shift reduces pressure on EU industrial policy
- US-China convergence, Europe maintains hybrid
- Squeezed between US-China state champions
- US improvised vs EU institutional frameworks
- Questions US sustainability across political cycles
