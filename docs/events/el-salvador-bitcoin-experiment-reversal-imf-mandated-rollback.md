# El Salvador Bitcoin Experiment Reversal: IMF-Mandated Rollback

**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Region**: Latin America/Global
**Impact Level**: medium

---

## Overview

El Salvador repealed Bitcoin as legal tender (January 30, 2025) to secure IMF $1.4B loan, making acceptance voluntary for private businesses and prohibiting use for taxes/government debts. Only 8.1% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin for payments (down from 25.7% first year), with 80% never using it. Remittances via crypto were 1.1% of $5.46B (Jan-Aug 2024), declining to 0.87% by December. IMF imposed continuous performance criteria with ceiling of 0 on new public sector Bitcoin acquisitions. Despite rollback, El Salvador purchased 12 more BTC in February 2025 (total 6,068+ BTC). Central African Republic parallel Bitcoin experiment (April 2022-2023) also failed with 85%+ lacking electricity and ~10% internet access.

## Regional Perspectives

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Near-universal framing as failed experiment: only 8.1% used Bitcoin, 80% never used it, 1% of remittances via crypto. IMF $1.4B loan conditional on removing Bitcoin as legal tender. Western economists emphasize volatility, lack of adoption, fiscal irresponsibility. Presents as cautionary tale against cryptocurrency hype and populist economic policies, with CAR parallel failure reinforcing narrative.

**Key Points**:
- January 30, 2025: Congress voted 55-2 to repeal legal tender status
- Only 8.1% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin (down from 25.7% year 1)
- 1.1% of remittances via crypto (0.87% by Dec 2024)
- IMF $1.4B loan conditional on rollback
- Central African Republic also failed after 1 year (2022-2023)

### Chinese State/Academic Perspective

Limited coverage but frames as validation of China CBDC (digital yuan) approach: state-controlled, centralized digital currency vs decentralized cryptocurrency. Chinese analysis presents El Salvador case as proof that unregulated crypto cannot serve monetary policy functions. Reinforces China position that digital currencies must be sovereign-issued and controlled.

**Key Points**:
- Validates state-controlled CBDC approach
- Demonstrates unregulated crypto unsuitability for monetary policy
- China digital yuan model vindicated
- Decentralized crypto lacks institutional backing
- Sovereign control essential for currency function

### Russian Perspective Perspective

Russian analysis sympathetic to anti-dollar intent but critical of execution. Russia exploring crypto for sanctions evasion but emphasizes need for state control. Views Bitcoin volatility as fatal flaw for reserve asset. Contrasts with Russia methodical gold accumulation and SPFS development as cautionary tale about rushing de-dollarization without proper infrastructure.

**Key Points**:
- Sympathetic to de-dollarization goal
- Bitcoin volatility fatal for reserve assets
- Russia prefers gold + state-controlled systems
- Methodical infrastructure building vs rushed implementation
- Crypto useful for sanctions evasion but not monetary policy
