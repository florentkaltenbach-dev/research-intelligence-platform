# US-China Semiconductor War: Export Control Reversals and Escalation

**Date**: 2025-03-01
**Region**: US-China
**Impact Level**: CRITICAL

---

## Overview

Trump administration pursued contradictory semiconductor policy in 2025. Tightening: added 42 Chinese entities to Entity List (March), 23 more (September); December 2024 expanded restricted list to 24 types of manufacturing equipment and 3 software tools; required Nvidia licenses for H20 GPU sales to China. Reversals: July 2025 lifted export restrictions on chip design software (Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens EDA); August allowed Nvidia AI processor sales to China with 15% revenue cut to US government. Biden's January 2025 'AI Diffusion Rule' (worldwide license for advanced ICs) quickly rescinded by Trump. China responded with rare earth controls, export bans on gallium/antimony/germanium, and $390M smuggling operation discovered.

## Regional Perspectives

### American Perspective

US semiconductor policy under Trump marked by contradictory moves balancing national security with industry pressure. Tightening measures: Entity List additions (65 total in 2025), equipment/software restrictions. But July 2025 reversal on design software and August deal allowing Nvidia China sales (with 15% government revenue cut) signal pragmatic approach. CHIPS Act implementation proceeding: first subsidy December 2023, Biden rushed $53B more post-election. However, predicted shortfall of 300,000 engineers and 90,000 technicians by 2030. CHIPS 2.0 unlikely. Enforcement challenges: $390M 'Luxuriate Your Life' smuggling ring discovered.

**Key Points**: ["65 Chinese entities added to Entity List in 2025", "July: lifted chip design software restrictions (Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens)", "August: Nvidia China sales allowed with 15% revenue to US government", "CHIPS Act: 300K engineer shortage predicted by 2030", "$390M GPU smuggling operation discovered (Dell/Supermicro servers to Malaysia)"]

### Chinese Perspective

China views US export controls as 'abuse' and economic coercion, calling out Trump administration in May 2025. Weaponized dominance in rare earths critical for semiconductors in response: expanded export controls October 2025 requiring government approval for designated rare earths. Export bans on gallium, antimony, germanium (indispensable for advanced semiconductors). China accelerating self-sufficiency drive despite US restrictions. However, 98% of Chinese banks rejected direct yuan payments from Russia due to secondary sanctions concerns, showing vulnerability to US financial pressure. China's semiconductor progress despite controls demonstrates limits of US restrictions.

**Key Points**: ["China calls out Trump for 'abuse' of semiconductor export controls (May 2025)", "Weaponized rare earth dominance in retaliation", "Export bans: gallium, antimony, germanium (critical for semiconductors)", "Self-sufficiency drive accelerating despite US restrictions", "Vulnerability: 98% of Chinese banks reject Russia yuan payments (secondary sanctions fear)"]

### Industry/Analyst Perspective

Analysts argue US restrictions harm American tech leadership rather than effectively containing China. Export controls reduce US companies' global market share and R&D revenues. China's semiconductor progress continues despite restrictions, with companies finding workarounds. The July 2025 reversal on design software and August Nvidia deal reflect industry pressure and recognition that overly broad controls hurt US more than China. However, enforcement remains challenging with smuggling operations ($390M ring discovered). Technology competition accelerating global fragmentation of semiconductor supply chains, with regional blocs forming. Long-term: tech restrictions push faster Chinese indigenization.

**Key Points**: ["Restrictions harm US tech leadership more than contain China", "Export controls reduce US companies' market share and R&D funding", "July/August reversals reflect industry pressure and policy pragmatism", "Enforcement challenges: sophisticated smuggling operations persist", "Accelerating supply chain fragmentation and regional blocs"]
