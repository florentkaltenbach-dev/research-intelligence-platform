# Energy Transition Geopolitics: Critical Minerals Competition Intensifies

**Date**: 2025-01-01
**Region**: Global
**Impact Level**: critical

---

## Overview

2025 saw intensification of geopolitical competition over critical minerals essential for energy transition. Demand surged: lithium +30%, nickel/cobalt/graphite/rare earths +6-8% in 2024, driven by EVs, battery storage, renewables, grid networks. However, supply concentration increased rather than diversified: top 3 refining nations' market share rose from 82% (2020) to 86% (2024). China dominates: 85-90% rare earth refining, 68% cobalt, 65% nickel, 60% lithium refining, 95% gallium. 84% of renewable energy stakeholders report geopolitical challenges causing substantial project delays/cancellations. China controls solar panel, battery component supply chains. IEA 2025 Global Critical Minerals Outlook warns of supply chain vulnerabilities. Western response: G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan, but non-Chinese separation capacity projected only 25-30% by 2027 vs. 10-15% today.

## Regional Perspectives

### Chinese Perspective

China views critical minerals dominance as strategic advantage in technology competition and energy transition. Controls 85-90% rare earth refining, 68% cobalt, 65% nickel, 60% lithium, 95% gallium. Dominant in downstream: 92% of NdFeB magnets, solar panel/battery component supply chains. This dominance result of decades of investment and industrial policy while West pursued financialization. China willing to weaponize this advantage: October 2025 expanded rare earth export controls, gallium/germanium/antimony export bans. As US weaponized semiconductors, China weaponizes materials. Green transition runs through China - 84% of renewables stakeholders report geopolitical delays. China's message: technology competition is two-way street.

**Key Points**:
- Critical minerals dominance: 85-90% rare earth refining, 68% cobalt, 65% nickel, 60% lithium
- Downstream control: 92% NdFeB magnets, solar/battery supply chains
- Decades of investment while West pursued financialization
- October 2025: weaponized via export controls, matching US semiconductor tactics
- 84% renewables projects face delays - green transition runs through China

### Western/EU-US Perspective

West faces critical vulnerability in energy transition: cannot decarbonize without Chinese-controlled supply chains. IEA 2025 Global Critical Minerals Outlook highlights concentration risks. Supply concentrated further 2020-2024 despite diversification rhetoric: top 3 nations' share rose 82% to 86%. 84% of renewable stakeholders report geopolitical delays/cancellations. G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan launched but progress slow: non-Chinese capacity projected only 25-30% by 2027. Tension between climate goals and geopolitical competition. Some argue overemphasis on China reduces Western competitiveness. Reality: achieving supply chain resilience requires sustained decades-long investment, political will questionable.

**Key Points**:
- Cannot achieve net-zero without Chinese supply chains currently
- IEA 2025 warns of concentration: 82% to 86% top-3 share (2020-2024)
- 84% renewables stakeholders report geopolitical project disruptions
- G7 plan: only 25-30% non-Chinese capacity by 2027 (from 10-15%)
- Tension: climate goals require cooperation, geopolitics demands competition

### European Perspective

EU in particularly difficult position: committed to aggressive climate targets but dependent on China for critical minerals AND solar panels AND battery components. Von der Leyen's 'weaponization' accusation highlights concern but alternatives limited. EU caught between US-China competition: US pressures Europe to decouple from China, but green transition timeline doesn't allow decade-long supply chain restructuring. 84% of renewables stakeholders face delays - threatens EU Green Deal timeline. Europe seeking third way: partnerships with Africa, Latin America for mining, but refining capacity takes years to build. Risk: EU climate ambitions become casualty of US-China great power competition.

**Key Points**:
- Aggressive climate targets but Chinese supply chain dependence
- Von der Leyen: China 'weaponizing' but alternatives limited
- Caught between US pressure to decouple and green transition urgency
- 84% renewables delays threaten EU Green Deal timeline
- Seeking African/Latin American partnerships but refining takes years

### Global South/Resource-Rich Nations Perspective

Resource-rich developing nations (Africa, Latin America) see opportunity in energy transition: possess raw materials but historically exploited via extraction without value-added processing. Learning from China's playbook: seeking to develop domestic refining capacity, not just mining. NDB (BRICS) offers alternative financing to Western institutions. However, challenges: refining requires technical expertise, environmental standards, massive capital investment. Risk of new dependency: China investing heavily in Global South mining operations - could replicate extractive patterns under different flag. Opportunity: leverage great power competition to negotiate better terms. Sovereignty concern: critical minerals becoming new oil - geopolitical curse?

**Key Points**:
- Possess raw materials but historically exploited without value-added
- Learning from China: develop refining capacity, not just mining
- BRICS NDB offers alternative to Western conditional financing
- Challenge: refining requires expertise, capital, environmental standards
- Risk: Chinese investment could replicate extraction under different flag
