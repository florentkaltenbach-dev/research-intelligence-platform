## Regional Perspectives

### Brazilian Perspective

Brazil's President Lula emphasized BRICS as a force for peace and multipolar governance reform under the theme 'Strengthening Global South Cooperation for More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance.' Brazil promoted 'Active Non-Alignment' doctrine, balancing between US and China. Concerns about rapid expansion diluting Brazil's influence and making BRICS appear Sino-centric rather than Global South-oriented. Emphasized BRICS economic performance: 4% growth vs 3.3% global average in 2024.

**Key Points**:
- BRICS must become a force capable of promoting peace and mediating conflicts
- Fundamental reform of UN Security Council needed for legitimacy and democracy
- 'Friends for Peace' group (China-Brazil led) aims to end conflicts like Ukraine
- Expansion risks diluting founding members' influence
- Maintain balance between Washington and Beijing under Active Non-Alignment

### Chinese Perspective

China views BRICS as cornerstone of multipolar world order without Western hegemony. At 2025 Munich Security Conference, Foreign Minister Wang Yi defined multipolarity as 'equality among all countries regardless of size' with equal voice in multilateral institutions. Emphasizes non-interference in sovereign affairs, diversity of civilizations, and opposition to 'Cold War mentality' and 'bullying practices.' Xi Jinping's vision: world where US hegemony is 'thing of the past' and liberalism/democracy are no longer sacrosanct.

**Key Points**:
- Multipolarity means equality without imperialism or hegemony, abiding by UN Charter
- Oppose hegemonism, Cold War mentality, and bullying practices
- US will succumb to tensions between global responsibilities and domestic care
- China does not aspire to same hegemony US once enjoyed
- Rally Global South support for reformed global order

### Russian Perspective

Russia pushes BRICS as mechanism for evading Western sanctions and reducing dollar dependence. Foreign Minister Lavrov announced BRICS Pay pilot 'before end of 2026,' later revised by Deputy FM Ryabkov to operational status by 2030. Promotes bilateral currency settlements: 95% of Russia-China trade ($244.8B in 2024) now in rubles/yuan. Nearly 90% of all Russia-China transactions in local currencies. Thirty Russian banks connected to Cross-Border Interbank Payment System by May 2025. Views BRICS as strategic alternative to Western-dominated financial architecture.

**Key Points**:
- BRICS Pay operational target: 2030 (revised from 2026 pilot)
- 95% of Russia-China trade in rubles/yuan, avoiding sanctions
- Alternative to SWIFT essential for strategic autonomy
- 30 Russian banks connected to China's CIPS by May 2025
- China essential partner for Russia; Russia less critical for China (asymmetric)

### Indian Perspective

India maintains strategic autonomy through multi-alignment strategy, engaging both BRICS (economic focus) and Quad (security focus). Back-to-back Quad foreign ministers meeting in Washington (July 1) and BRICS summit in Rio (July 6-7) highlighted increasingly difficult balancing act. Views BRICS primarily as economic rather than geopolitical grouping, unlike China and Russia. Resists any evolution toward formal military alliance that would compromise autonomy. Uses BRICS to hedge against US while using Quad to hedge against China.

**Key Points**:
- Multi-alignment prevents over-dependence on any single power
- BRICS supports India's global governance reform ambitions
- Strategic hedging: Quad for China deterrence, BRICS to maintain autonomy from US
- Any formal military alliance in Quad would be resisted by New Delhi
- Strategic autonomy is coherent doctrine, not fence-sitting

### Nigerian/African Perspective

Nigeria officially became BRICS partner country in January 2025. African nations view BRICS as opportunity for infrastructure investment and alternative financing with less restrictive conditions than Western institutions. New Development Bank (NDB) provided $1B to South Africa, $200M to Egypt in 2024, with growing local currency lending. Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed emphasized BRICS as platform for infrastructure investment, manufacturing, climate resilience. Focus on energy/mineral sectors and technology transfer opportunities. Intra-BRICS trade surpassed $5 trillion in 2024.

**Key Points**:
- BRICS financing offers fewer conditions than IMF/World Bank
- New Development Bank increasing local currency loans
- Infrastructure investment critical for African industrialization
- Access to BRICS markets and technology transfer
- NDB: $1B South Africa, $200M Egypt in 2024; ZAR 18.5B for Transnet rail

### Western/American Perspective

Trump administration views BRICS de-dollarization as direct threat to US financial hegemony and 'exorbitant privilege.' Renewed threats of 100% tariffs on BRICS nations continuing de-dollarization efforts. Dollar's share in global forex reserves slipped to two-decade low of ~58% by Q1 2025. US Dollar Index dropped 9.9% YTD September 2025. Skepticism about BRICS payment system viability due to internal contradictions, currency convertibility issues (yuan, rupee), and competing national interests. Assessment: no viable alternative to dollar exists currently, but facing creeping regional displacement.

**Key Points**:
- Trump threatens 100% tariffs on BRICS de-dollarization efforts
- Dollar reserve currency share declined to ~58% by Q1 2025 (two-decade low)
- BRICS internal contradictions limit effectiveness as anti-Western bloc
- Currency convertibility issues (yuan, rupee) hinder payment system
- No imminent dollar replacement but slow, gradual decline of dominance
