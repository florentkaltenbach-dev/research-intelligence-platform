# Africa in Multipolar Order: 30% Critical Minerals & US-China Competition

**Date**: 2025-01-01
**Region**: Africa
**Impact Level**: high

---

## Overview

Africa holds ~30% of global critical mineral deposits. DRC produces 75% of global cobalt output. China invested $4.5B in lithium projects (Zimbabwe, DRC, Mali, Namibia), dominates refining and supply chains. US/EU seek access through partnerships to break Chinese dominance. BRICS expansion includes Egypt, Ethiopia - network now 50% global GDP (PPP) and >50% world population. Africa's importance rising: UN voting power (54 nations), critical minerals for green transition, young demographics (median age 19 vs 43 Europe), migration concerns for Europe. Chinese-led South-South cooperation competing with Western development models. Strategic autonomy allows African states to play rivals against each other for better deals.

## Regional Perspectives

### Western/US Perspective Perspective

Africa seen as critical battleground in great power competition, particularly for minerals essential to green energy transition. US/EU recognize late start vs China's decade-plus infrastructure/mining investments. Approach: Partnerships and 'values-based' investment emphasizing governance, transparency, labor standards vs Chinese model. Concerned about losing influence - China doesn't demand political reforms, making it attractive partner for African governments. Migration pressure from Africa to Europe adds urgency to engagement. Sees Africa's 54 UN votes as geopolitically significant. Strategy: Build Better World, Prosper Africa initiatives to counter BRI.

**Key Points**:
- Africa critical for green transition minerals
- Late start vs China decade-plus investments
- Partnership approach emphasizing governance/transparency
- China no-strings approach more attractive to African govts
- Migration concerns drive European engagement
- 54 UN votes geopolitically significant

### Chinese Perspective Perspective

Frames Africa engagement as South-South cooperation and anti-colonial solidarity, contrasting with Western 'neo-imperialism.' China's $4.5B lithium investments and infrastructure projects presented as win-win development. No political conditionality seen as respecting sovereignty vs Western imposing values. BRI in Africa: Roads, rails, ports, energy projects addressing infrastructure gap Western countries failed to fill. BRICS expansion including Egypt, Ethiopia strengthens Global South bloc. Long-term: Africa's young population (1.3B now, 2.5B by 2050) represents future consumer market and geopolitical weight. China positioning early for African century.

**Key Points**:
- South-South cooperation vs Western neo-imperialism
- $4.5B lithium + infrastructure = win-win development
- No political conditions respects sovereignty
- BRI fills infrastructure gap West neglected
- BRICS expansion (Egypt, Ethiopia) strengthens Global South
- Africa's young population = future market and power

### African Perspective Perspective

African states increasingly asserting strategic autonomy, playing great powers against each other for better deals. Frustrated with Western conditionality and lectures while China delivers infrastructure. Resource nationalism rising: African states demanding more value capture - processing, refining locally vs exporting raw materials. DRC pushing to process cobalt domestically. BRICS membership (South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia) seen as diversifying options beyond West-dominated institutions. Concerns about Chinese debt, labor practices, but pragmatic about needing investment. Youth bulge offers demographic dividend if jobs created, crisis if not. Climate change disproportionately affecting Africa despite minimal contribution to emissions.

**Key Points**:
- Strategic autonomy: Playing powers against each other
- China delivers infrastructure, West lectures
- Resource nationalism rising: Local processing demanded
- BRICS diversifies options beyond Western institutions
- Chinese debt concerns but need investment
- Youth bulge: Dividend if jobs, crisis if not
