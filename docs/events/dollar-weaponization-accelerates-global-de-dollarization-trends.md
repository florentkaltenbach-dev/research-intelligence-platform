## Overview

2025 marked acceleration of de-dollarization following February 2022 freezing of $300B in Russian forex reserves. Dollar share in global reserves hit two-decade low of ~58% by Q1 2025. US Dollar Index dropped 9.9% YTD September 2025. Many countries moving away from dollar as reserve currency coinciding with Trump's isolationist foreign policy and erratic economic policy. 90% of Russia-China trade in yuan/rubles. India, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkey trading with Russia in non-dollar currencies despite sanctions. Trump threatens 100% tariffs on countries pursuing de-dollarization.

## Regional Perspectives

### American Perspective

US views de-dollarization as existential threat to 'exorbitant privilege' - ability to print world's reserve currency. Trump administration renewed 100% tariff threats on BRICS nations pursuing de-dollarization. However, weaponization via Russian asset freeze ($300B February 2022) catalyzed very trend US fears. Dollar Index dropped 9.9% YTD September 2025. Reserve currency share at two-decade low (~58% Q1 2025). Heritage Foundation warns 'woke' sanctions and dollar abandonment will ruin world, not just US. Federal Reserve 2025 report acknowledges creeping regional displacement but maintains no imminent collapse risk. US faces dilemma: sanctions are powerful tool but overuse accelerates de-dollarization.

**Key Points**:
- Trump threatens 100% tariffs on de-dollarization efforts
- Dollar Index -9.9% YTD September, reserves at ~58% (20-year low)
- Russian asset freeze ($300B) catalyzed global de-dollarization concerns
- Fed 2025: creeping regional displacement, not imminent collapse
- Dilemma: sanctions powerful but overuse accelerates dollar abandonment

### Russian Perspective

Russia leads de-dollarization push after $300B asset freeze in February 2022 demonstrated dollar vulnerability. 90% of Russia-China trade ($244.8B in 2024) now in rubles/yuan. Nearly 90% of all Russia-China transactions in local currencies. 30 Russian banks connected to China's CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System) by May 2025. However, 98% of Chinese banks rejected direct yuan payments from Russia due to secondary sanctions concerns - exposing vulnerability to US financial pressure. Russia views de-dollarization as essential strategic autonomy measure, but progress limited by Western financial system's network effects and China's caution.

**Key Points**:
- $300B asset freeze (Feb 2022) proved dollar is weaponized
- 90% Russia-China trade in rubles/yuan ($244.8B in 2024)
- 30 Russian banks on China's CIPS by May 2025
- Vulnerability: 98% Chinese banks reject Russia yuan payments (sanctions fear)
- De-dollarization essential for strategic autonomy despite challenges

### Chinese Perspective

China cautiously pursues yuan internationalization without directly challenging dollar dominance. 90% of Russia-China trade in yuan/rubles demonstrates progress. September 2025: inaugurated international operations centre for digital yuan in Shanghai. Project mBridge connects banks in China, Thailand, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia for wholesale CBDC cross-border payments. However, yuan's proportion in global reserves remains limited. Yuan not fully convertible, capital controls persist. 98% of Chinese banks rejected Russia yuan payments shows China prioritizes US financial system access over challenging dollar. Strategy: gradual yuan internationalization in friendly markets, not frontal assault on dollar hegemony.

**Key Points**:
- 90% Russia-China trade in yuan/rubles, gradual internationalization
- September 2025: digital yuan international operations centre in Shanghai
- Project mBridge: China, Thailand, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia
- Yuan not fully convertible, capital controls limit global use
- 98% banks reject Russia yuan payments - prioritize US system access

### Global South/Non-Aligned Perspective

Global South increasingly views dollar dependence as vulnerability after Russian asset freeze demonstrated US willingness to weaponize financial system even against major economies. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath advises developing countries opt for non-alignment to benefit from new Cold War. India, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkey trading with Russia in non-dollar currencies despite US pressure. However, practical alternatives limited: no currency offers dollar's combination of liquidity, stability, and institutional backing. Result: pragmatic hedging - maintain dollar reserves while diversifying and developing regional payment systems. Emphasis on financial sovereignty and reducing exposure to unilateral sanctions.

**Key Points**:
- Russian freeze showed US will weaponize against major economies
- IMF Gopinath: developing countries should opt for non-alignment benefits
- India, Saudi, UAE, Turkey trading with Russia in local currencies
- No viable full alternative to dollar yet exists
- Strategy: pragmatic hedging and regional payment system development

### Analyst/Academic Perspective

Experts assess de-dollarization as real long-term trend but not imminent collapse. Dollar share slipped from peak but still dominant at ~58% of reserves (Q1 2025). Key insight: current push more widespread than past efforts, suggesting structural shift rather than temporary fluctuation. However, no currency offers viable alternative: euro constrained by EU fragmentation, yuan not fully convertible, no other currency has scale. Likely outcome: slow, gradual decline toward multipolar reserve currency system rather than sudden displacement. Factors accelerating trend: US weaponization, debt concerns, Trump's erratic policy. Factors supporting dollar: network effects, institutional depth, no alternative with comparable liquidity/stability.

**Key Points**:
- Real long-term trend but not imminent collapse
- ~58% reserves Q1 2025 - still dominant but declining from peak
- More widespread than past efforts, suggesting structural shift
- No viable alternative: euro limited, yuan restricted, others lack scale
- Likely: slow multipolar evolution, not sudden displacement
