## Regional Perspectives

### Test Region Perspective

Test summary

**Key Points**:
- Point 1
- Point 2

---

### Western Mainstream Perspective

Western analysis frames as safe haven demand driven by geopolitical uncertainty, inflation hedging, and portfolio diversification. World Gold Council reports emphasize purchases at double the 2010-2021 average. Generally treats as prudent monetary policy without deep geopolitical implications, highlighting Poland (67t H1 2025) and Turkey as leading buyers.

**Key Points**:
- 3,220 tonnes purchased 2022-2024 (3x historical average)
- 2022: 1,136t (record), 2023: 1,037t, 2024: 1,044.6t
- Framed as inflation hedge and geopolitical uncertainty response
- Poland leading with 67t in H1 2025 alone
- 77% of central banks plan continued purchases

### Chinese State/Academic Perspective

PBOC officially added 44 tonnes in 2024, resuming purchases in November 2024. However, Goldman Sachs estimates actual purchases ~40t/month, with one analysis claiming 570t covertly purchased in 2024. Chinese academic sources frame as reserve diversification consistent with yuan internationalization strategy, viewing Western reporting with suspicion. Gold represents only ~5% of China reserves vs 15% global average, suggesting room for expansion.

**Key Points**:
- Official: 44t added in 2024, total 2,298.53t by Q2 2025
- Alternative estimates: 570t purchased covertly in 2024
- Goldman Sachs estimates ~40t/month actual purchases
- Gold only 5% of reserves vs 15% global average
- Consistent with yuan internationalization strategy

### Russian Perspective Perspective

Most explicit narrative: directly frames as response to weaponization of dollar and Western sanctions. Russia accumulated 1,244 tonnes (40M oz) from 2014-2020 post-Crimea as prescient strategy. Gold reserves now worth $229B (34.4% of $650B total reserves), offsetting ~33% of $322B frozen assets. Gold appreciation of +$96B (+72%) since early 2022. Presents as essential financial sovereignty tool and insurance against economic warfare, with 2022 proving strategy correct.

**Key Points**:
- Russia holds 75M oz (~2,330t) worth $229B
- Represents 34-35% of Russia total reserves
- Accumulated 40M oz between 2014-2020 (post-Crimea)
- $322B forex frozen by Western sanctions (2022)
- Gold gains (+$96B) offset 33% of frozen asset losses

### Indian Interpretation Perspective

RBI gold holdings reached 800.78 tonnes (8% of reserves) by September 2023, adding 73t in 2024. Indian analysis presents as dual dynamic where official and consumer demand reinforce each other - cultural affinity meeting monetary policy. Frames gold accumulation as consistent with India 5,000-year gold culture while modernizing reserve management. Less explicitly geopolitical than Russian narrative, emphasizing prudent diversification.

**Key Points**:
- RBI holds 800.78t (8% of total reserves)
- Added 73 tonnes in 2024
- Cultural-institutional synthesis approach
- 5,000-year gold cultural tradition
- Modernizing reserve management while honoring tradition
