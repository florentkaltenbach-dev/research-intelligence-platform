# Events: Major Developments in Global Financial Architecture

Comprehensive catalog of verified events shaping the transition to multipolar financial systems (2022-2025).

## Active Events (2025)

### [Central Bank Gold Accumulation: 3,220 Tonnes in 3 Years](/events/central-bank-gold-2024)
**Date**: 2022-2024 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Central banks purchased 3,220 tonnes of gold (2022-2024), **3x historical average**. Both emerging markets (China, Russia, India) AND Western-aligned states (Poland, Turkey) accumulating at historic rates. 77% of central banks plan continued purchases through 2026.

**Key Finding**: Cross-geopolitical consensus on gold accumulation suggests shared concerns about fiat currency system stability.

---

### [Capital Flight to UAE/Singapore: 142,000 Millionaires Relocating](/events/capital-flight-uae-singapore)
**Date**: 2025 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Record 142,000 HNWIs relocating in 2025, described as "largest voluntary transfer of private capital in modern history." UAE leads (+9,800), UK shows largest outflow (-16,500). Vote-by-capital on institutional quality.

**Key Finding**: Multi-system access (UAE model) outcompeting traditional financial centers.

---

### [China's CIPS Expansion to 185+ Countries](/events/china-cips-expansion)
**Date**: 2015-2025 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

CIPS reaches 189 countries processing 175.49T yuan ($24.47T) in 2024 (+42.6% YoY). However, yuan remains only 3% of SWIFT payments vs 48% USD. Infrastructure built first, adoption follows gradually over decades.

**Key Finding**: Payment infrastructure development precedes currency adoption by 20-30 years.

---

### [Saudi PIF's $913B Repositioning & US Equity Reduction](/events/saudi-pif-repositioning)
**Date**: 2021-2025 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

US equity exposure: $60B (2021) → $23.8B (Q2 2025) = 61% decline. Signed $50B agreements with Chinese banks (Aug 2024). Pattern: Optionality through diversification while maintaining diplomatic balance.

**Key Finding**: Financial diversification ≠ political realignment.

---

## Completed Experiments (2025)

### [El Salvador Bitcoin Experiment Reversal](/events/el-salvador-bitcoin-reversal)
**Date**: Sept 2021 - Jan 2025 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Repealed Bitcoin legal tender (Jan 30, 2025) after 3.5 years. Only 8.1% adoption, 80% never used Bitcoin, crypto remittances declined to 0.87%. Rare cross-regional consensus: Unregulated crypto cannot fulfill monetary functions.

**Key Finding**: Legal tender status ≠ organic adoption. Volatility incompatible with daily commerce.

---

## Ongoing Developments

### [BRICS Payment Systems: Fragmentation NOT Unity](/events/brics-payment-systems)
**Date**: 2021-2025 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

"90% intra-BRICS local currency trade" is primarily China-Russia bilateral (95% of $245B), NOT pan-BRICS pattern. India explicitly rejects de-dollarization. BRICS Pay delayed to 2030. Competing national systems (CIPS, SPFS, India's SRVA) pursuing separate strategies.

**Key Finding**: "BRICS de-dollarization" is Western construct, not BRICS self-description.

---

### [Islamic Finance Growth: $6T → $9.7T by 2029](/events/islamic-finance-growth)
**Date**: 2020-2029 | **Confidence**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

$5.98T end 2024 with 10% CAGR projection. Sector exceeds many G20 economies yet receives minimal Western coverage. GCC holds 50% of assets, Iran/Saudi/Malaysia command 72% of total. Sukuk market >$1T outstanding.

**Key Finding**: Western scale blindness - $6T sector larger than France's GDP receives minimal coverage.

## What Connects These Events?

### Pattern: Optionality Over Replacement
Countries/institutions building alternatives to have OPTIONS, not replace dollar entirely:
- UAE/Singapore success = offering access to BOTH systems (dollar AND alternatives)
- Gold accumulation = hedge not abandonment
- CIPS participation = option for yuan settlement, not dollar exit
- Gulf states maintain US relationships while developing China corridor

### Pattern: Infrastructure Determinism
Payment systems/physical assets more important than currencies initially:
- CIPS expansion (infrastructure) precedes yuan dominance (usage)
- Gold (physical asset) more important than digital alternatives (crypto failure)
- Actual trade flows determine payment system adoption (China-Russia 95% follows $245B trade)

### Pattern: Incrementalism vs Revolution
No dramatic "dollar collapse" moment - systematic erosion through thousand cuts:
- CIPS added 189 countries gradually over decade
- Central banks bought gold consistently for 15 years
- Yuan share in trade rose 0% → 8.5% over 10 years
- Islamic finance grew 10-15% CAGR every year

**Western media seeks dramatic moment; misses steady structural shift.**

---

## Next Research Priorities

1. Track BRICS Pay implementation progress toward 2030 target
2. Monitor China's actual vs official gold purchases
3. Follow CIPS expansion in Latin America (next frontier?)
4. Analyze Islamic finance integration with BRI projects
5. Track dollar reserve share quarterly vs 40-45% 2030 projection
