# Synthesis Research Approach

## Goal
Combine findings from multiple research sessions into cohesive analyses that identify patterns, consensus points, and genuine disagreements.

## Steps

### 1. Review Existing Research
- Read through Events and their Perspectives
- Review collected Metrics
- Examine previous Analyses

### 2. Identify Themes
- What patterns emerge across multiple events?
- Where do different regions agree?
- Where are there fundamental disagreements?

### 3. Create Synthesis
Write analysis that:
- Combines multiple perspectives
- Identifies common threads
- Highlights genuine conflicts (not false balance)
- Draws conclusions with appropriate confidence levels

### 4. Rate Confidence
Use 1-5 star system:
- ⭐ = Speculative, low confidence
- ⭐⭐ = Some evidence, uncertain
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Moderate confidence, supported
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = High confidence, well-evidenced
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Very high confidence, overwhelming evidence

### 5. Document Approach
Note which research approaches fed into this synthesis (Source Diversification, Data Collection, etc.).

## Example Prompt for Claude Code

```
Create a synthesis analysis of "Dedollarization trends 2023-2024".

Review:
1. All Events related to dedollarization
2. Currency metrics (USD share of reserves, trade settlements)
3. Perspectives from different regions

Write a synthesis that:
- Summarizes the overall trend
- Identifies where there's consensus
- Notes regional differences in approach
- Assigns confidence level to key claims
- Cites specific events and data points

Save as an Analysis in the database with appropriate confidence stars.
```

## Tips
- Avoid false balance (not all perspectives are equally valid)
- Cite specific events and data
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
- Update syntheses as new information emerges
- Use confidence levels honestly
