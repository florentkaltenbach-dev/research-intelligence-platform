# Source Diversification Research Approach

## Goal
Find and analyze perspectives from diverse regional sources, especially non-Western viewpoints that are often underrepresented in English-language research.

## Steps

### 1. Identify the Topic/Event
Clearly define what you're researching (e.g., "BRICS currency proposals 2024").

### 2. Search for Diverse Sources
Use web search to find sources from:
- **Chinese**: Search in Chinese or use Chinese media outlets (CGTN, Global Times, Xinhua)
- **Russian**: RT, TASS, Sputnik, Russian government statements
- **Arabic**: Al Jazeera, Middle East Eye, regional news outlets
- **Hindi/Indian**: Times of India, The Hindu, Indian Express
- **Other regions**: African, Latin American, Southeast Asian perspectives

### 3. Extract Key Points
For each source:
- Summarize the main perspective
- Note key facts or claims made
- Identify unique framing or emphasis
- Document the source credibility (Tier 1-4)

### 4. Compare and Contrast
- How do perspectives differ by region?
- What aspects are emphasized in one region vs another?
- Are there common themes or sharp disagreements?

### 5. Document in Database
- Create Event in database
- Add Perspective for each regional viewpoint
- Link to Source records with proper credibility ratings
- Include language tags

## Example Prompt for Claude Code

```
Research the "Saudi Arabia PIF dedollarization 2024" using the Source Diversification approach.

Search for perspectives from:
1. Chinese sources (how do they frame it?)
2. Russian sources (what do they emphasize?)
3. Middle Eastern Arabic sources (how is it covered locally?)
4. Western sources (for comparison)

For each perspective:
- Summarize the main narrative
- Extract 3-5 key points
- Rate the source credibility
- Note the language

Then create an Event in the database with Perspectives for each region, properly cited.
```

## Tips
- Use translated versions of non-English sources
- Look for official government statements vs media coverage
- Pay attention to what's NOT being said in certain regions
- Consider the source's audience and purpose
